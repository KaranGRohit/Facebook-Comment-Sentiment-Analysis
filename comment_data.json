{"comment":{"0":"I state now and for the record, Russia did not make me vote for Donald Trump, however, Hillary Clinton, Barak Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer did.","1":"I can GUARANTEE you that Russia had no influence whatsoever in me voting for Trump. I\u2019m a grown woman who makes decision based on the best candidate for the job. It\u2019s just insane.","2":"Hmmmm....so this Russia interference started in 2014 which means Obummer and his administration did nothing to stop them for three years!! Somehow Trumps administration figures it out in a year?  Another win win for Trump and continues to show just how incompetent the Obummer administration was;) MAGA!!","3":"Looks like the US economy is doing very good,the stock market up,the job market is improving significantly,adding one and a half million of new positions.Illegal crossing down 75%.President Donald Trump will be re-elected ,America will vote for him again,me too!\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8","4":"Every time a vote is cast by someone who is not a legal US citizen it\u2019s foreign interference. I wish they would spend this much effort on checking CA\u2019s voting records.","5":"Its okay president Trump, we know there was no collusion and it's just another made up conspiracy from the left who just can't get over the election results \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2","6":"Wow, millions of dollars spent and countless hours of MSM coverage to indict a couple of Russians for misusing Facebook! \n\nObviously over-simplifying this a bit, but that's the gist of it :)","7":"This has far more to do with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.  He allowed our nations security to be so lax as to allow foreign entities access to the country.  We all know they had their perfect puppet with Hillary Clinton. For the right price, she would have sold them the country.","8":"Done and done.  This confirms what many of us have known for a long time.  For God's sake, mainstream media, your collusion theory is dead and buried, and don't EVER bring it up again.","9":"So true the only people fooled by their crap was the media.   Makes you fear for our journalists they are so stupid.","10":"\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude09  POTUS  MAGA  .... the left  would call for a special council if you put  Russian  dressing on your salad  ......2020  will be an easy win !!","11":"I think Kil-LIAR-y will make this just one more excuse for her loss.

Go get the real crooks, barry and Bengazi Butcher!","13":"This Russia thing is getting old now, the real crooks are the Desperate Dems they'd do anything to invalidate Trump.

They're just sad about losing the election and can't express it like adults.  Sorry.  Sincerely, America.","15":"We know there was no Russian collusion ...this seems to be the dems. latest story to cover their backsides for their collusion to try to fix the elections.","16":"We  stand behind you Mr President  and believe there is no collusion.  The other side looks so stupid with what they are  saying. They always have  an answer but people see right thru them. They are convincing no one","17":"Shepard Smith on Fox news is Jumping way ahead ,he needs to get things right befor opening his mouth.","18":"We knew that Mr President!  Thank you!

Shouldn\u2019t we have justice for American Citizens committing crimes. Spend some $$ on this also!","20":"All of your supporters knew their was no collusion. Now lets get to the bottom of the corruption in the FBI and the DOJ and State dept.","21":"We all knew it, President Trump. Just one more reason for the clueless left to gnash their teeth and find something else about which to whine!","22":"thanks for saving the country","23":"Your first instinct is to distance yourself. Shouldn\u2019t it be to be outraged on behalf of US citizens, and condemn these actions? #pospotus","24":"We all know that Russia had nothing to do with Trump's win. This is all just an embarrassment on the party of sore losers!!","25":"No russian influenced me to vote for you. I voted for you because I love my family, I love my country and I despise Anti-American policies that we had to put up with for 8 years.  #MAGA #AMERICAFIRST","26":"We have always known the Democrats and MSM were the ones that colluded with Russia. HRC cheated and she still couldn't win.","27":"31% of the world\u2019s mass shootings occur in the U.S., although it has only 5% of the world's population.

It's very easy to see what's going on here. Thank you for helping to make this country great again. Keep up the good work and God bless America.","29":"Of course you didn't do anything wrong! But your opponent certainly did and they're just trying to deflect the guilt, which isn't working!","30":"We believe you sir..keep up the fight, drain the swap, build the wall..foot note is I have a sign in your house  ;)","31":"Sir, call them out by name and who they talked with in US. Give lessons from podium on economies, and differences between communism and capitalism. Thank you","32":"Now it\u2019s time for the real investigation into Hillary and her campaign and the Obama administration!!!","33":"Russia had nothing to do with the way I voted. Dumbocrats have tried to ruin this nation and I would never have voted for Killary.","34":"There was collusion,  but that collusion came from the clinton camp... Bought and paid for,  just as mueller is on the clinton payroll to do anything to disparage our wonderful,  honest,  patriotic,  humanitarian president Trump!","35":"I commented on the nether Thread about this you want to talk about snowflakes melting down! Wow! Then guys will not believe anything Rod Rosenstein just said they are making things up to convince themselves that Trump is going to get impeached it's almost laughable except it's kind of scary that they are so blind to truth","36":"Their game is over.....now the facts from the IG report will lay out where the real corruption occurred and who were the key players....and all roads will lead to Obama .....with many casualties of lives and careers in his wake. Par for the Clintons and Obama.","37":"You're doing a great job president Trump.   Keep up the good work and hopefully congress and the AG office will get the real collusion that involved the democrats.  Obama, his AG, his fbi cronies..","38":"Fact is if Killary would of won, none of this so called collusion crap would of even made a blip on local news, never mind the national scale. \n\n<3 my President Donald J. Trump keep it up, you are not alone!","39":"Russia has been interfering in our politics since they were the USSR and we do the same to them !! The only difference is TRUMP WON If clinton had won, the left would have said. Whats the big deal, they do it to us we do it to them.","40":"This witchhunt happened to distract and take away from the fact that HRC was the one colluding with Russia, she's had her hand in multiple illegal schemes, they set the narrative bc she couldn't accept losing and the plan was to try to get DJT impeached, or out of office one way or another.  It's so very obvious and really quite pathetic.","41":"This former CT Democrat will be voting Republican from now on.","42":"Is it only wrong to commit a crime if it has an effect?  Is it ok to steal from stores that have shrink budgeted in...because they\u2019ve already planned to lose the money, so there\u2019s no impact?  Should Russia not be dealt with for their attempt?  Should anyone who helped them, whether it worked or not, be free from prosecution?  Of course not.","43":"False flag to take away from the DNC involvement in the Dossier and finding out what was in the FISA wattant applications....Not that I doubt Russia may have wanted Trump over Clinton but that probably just balanced the playing field since Soros was paying people and bussing them to rallies also.","44":"So if you\u2019re finally admitting that Russia did interfere in our election, maybe now you can see that we should be trying to prevent them from doing it again.","45":"Basically, Russia engaged in acts that the Dems and their partners from the Left-wing media engage in all the time....PROPAGANDA!!","46":"Ha!Ha! We all knew you President Trump did nothing wrong! Now I'd like an investigation into the Democratic Party, and all that colluded with Russia, and other countries! What a big waste of taxpayers money the Dems have spent!","47":"The FBI needs a complete overhaul. Wasting time on an investigation, yet ignoring tips on the guy who shot up the FL high school.","48":"This could be great, they indict Russian nationals for spreading \"derogatory\" statements about Hillary Clinton.  So each of these statements will have to be thoroughly investigated.  Also, if you prosecute people for  saying bad things what do you do about the Liberal News media and the Democratic parties fake news?","49":"Russia did nothing to persuade me to vote Trump. I vote for who I believe will do the best job. Thank you President Trump for your great service to our country.","50":"Now that the Trump\/Russia collusion lie is officially dead, what will Rachel Maddow, Jimmy Fallon, The View, MSNBC, CBS and the rest of the loony left lie about next? Stay tuned!","51":"That is correct.  Now they should have announced today the real russian collusion and indicted Hillary, Obama, Comey, Lynch, Mueller and Rosenstien.  AG Sessions needs to do his job.  There was no collusion between Russia and Trump campaign.  Best President ever and they are still trying to find something.  Wish they would decide to work as hard as they are trying to find dirt.","52":"Many intel people say Russia has messed in our elections for years and years. The DNC and Hillary colluded with them in the last one. Dems always did love Russia and the oppression it represents.","53":"If you are so innocent, Donnie, why didn't you take 10 minutes to make a statement to respond to these indictments to reassure the American people?? In too much of a hurry to go golfing or do you know you are going down very soon? \ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89","54":"It's a shame, at this point, that you even have to say so any more.\nThe media and holdovers outed themselves.\nCarry on. Any progress on rooting out the Patriot Act?\nAt this rate, you might as well be keeping OBAMA'S campaign promises, too.","55":"Russia sure didn't tap my brain and tell me who to vote for. I still thank god everyday that Hillary didn't get to be president. I knew how awful she was way before you ever decided to run. I know you may not get everything done with the way the democrats and anti-trumpers are but you are fighting for it and can respect that. Just keep doing what your doing run again I'll vote for you, just remember the end of the second term is when you give it to them good. #Maga !","56":"We are in a time of fire and unveiling\nA time of endings and new beginnings\nThis is a time for healing and the release of any old version of self that wasn\u2019t loved well and deeply in the ways it needed most \nIt\u2019s a time for opening a new door and stepping through it.","57":"When are we going to investigate real crimes like mishandling classified information, fraud and conspiracy to sell 1\/5 of our uranium to Russia and the real Russian collusion which helped to manufacture a false document used to obtain a FISA warrant?","58":"I like how the democrats say that the russians hurt the election by hacking their emails. All that the hackers did was post the emails where democrats where bad mouthing voters and rigging an election.","59":"I was just going to ask about this---as the news popped up on Yahoo...that 13 ppl were indicted...Russians---for interferring in the election....","60":"If it's true that BLM was a Russian group. Then wouldn't it be the dems, that concluded?\nHell ! BLM was on the stage at the DNC.","61":"We know that. The democrats and the media know that. They can't admit it. And the democrats and media are now going to blame anything bad that happens on our President, leading up to the 2018 elections. Everything they say TRUMP should have done or should do.obama should have done,could have done. TRUMP 2020. Election more Republicans in 2018.","62":"I voted for My President because he has America's heart and is willing to fight for us and bring America back to where we are... America First and have our own government again.","63":"See, that's what you just don't get.  It's not about you. It's about a foreign power attempting to influence our elections. You're the president -- and should be taking this very, very seriously.  You don't know if they've successfully impacted elections or not, but you should be doing every possible thing you can to determine if that's true or not. Instead, all you do is squawk \"Not me!  Not me!\"  It's about our democracy being under attack, not about a single election. Do your job.","64":"The dems are absolutely fixated on Russia ! Now start getting fixated on Clinton and obama. I think we should fire all the people in the FBI and start over ! After what happen in Florida shows me your not doing your job. To busy trying to find dirt on our President Donald J. Trump.","65":"Exactly....can we now go after hillary. Obama etc...the people who are corrupt!! Pelosi. Schumer...take them all out on 1 bus....your an amazing president! Go Trump MAGA!!!!!","66":"whhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat ? ! boy they had us scared, huh? NOT! mr. president you keep draining the swamp. mueller's got to go. he actually delivered samples of uranium, to russia in sept 2009. i want to see these people in court rooms. let get it done!","67":"Love you mr president thank you for everything But when are the real criminals Obama and Clinton and that whole crime cartel going to be indicted We are waiting....","68":"We are living in a generation where kids are eating laundry detergent, and somehow the liberals believe we have a gun Problem lol we dont need gun control, we need liberal control","69":"So they knew about this for 4 years but did nothing to about it.  I just want to say that no Russians spoke to me or sent me anything to cause me to cast my vote for President Donald J. Trump.  Our President was running on what I believe in which is tax reform, immigration reform, border secruity, growing our econmony, building our country, healthcare reform and putting American citizens first for a change. We need to be stronger America.","70":"Still not one shred of evidence concluding that Trump colluded with Russians. Sorry to inform you but all countries try to interfere in foreign elections and if you think the United States is so innocent then you're in for a rude awakening","71":"But we do know the DNC colluded...how do we know they don't have backdoor hackers making it look like Russia to obsolve themselves? Hmmmm..and this comes out after all the info on fisa warrants...wise as serpents, harmless as doves Mr. president....","72":"Of course - - we knew it. Those implying there was collusion knew it!\n\nKeep doing what you're doing, Mr. President.\n\nOh, one more thing: You said you'd put Hillary Clinton in jail. I haven't seen that promise fulfilled. Where's the handcuffs?","73":"Meanwhile the mountain of evidence against the DNC, Hillary campaign and Obama-era administration is piling up rather high. Time for some indictments already. Russia can take a goddamn number.","74":"They are trying to make it look like they are investigating something. The Russians had absolutely no impact whatsoever on our elections. It's incredible what people do these days to make themselves look useful and save their jobs after the reports by Devon Nunez they had to produce something.","75":"Ok, stop talking about this, do something to stop school shootings!  I'm not caring about Russia, I care about our kids going to American schools and getting killed, and I'm your supporter","76":"But I thought Donald Trump was the one who colluded with Russians?\n\nHowever, the same names keep popping up of government officials who apparently did help the Russians and none of them look anything like Trump\u2019s name.\n\nBarack Obama.\n\nHillary Clinton.\n\nJohn Kerry.\n\nLoretta Lynch.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on and on.","77":"The last thing the Russian's wanted was you as our President. They were all in for Uranium girl. Russians have been messing with us since the 1950's. The major centers for Russian communist propaganda have historically been NYC, San Francisco and Washington D.C. It's obvious they have infiltrated our academia and Hollywood.","78":"#FlashbackFriday\n2012 Mitt Romney for calling Russia the US\u2019s \u201cnumber one geopolitical foe,\u201d Obama\u2019s response?!  \u201cthe 80s called and wants their foreign policy back.\u201d  \nThanks Obama","79":"The Democrats keep pushing the Russian collusion lie, meanwhile they run Bernie Sanders and his communist ideals, Bernie literally honeymooned in the heart of the old Soviet Union! The level of hypocrisy within the Democratic party is astounding...","80":"Of course you didn't.  The globalist \/elitists are pissed as you put a wrench into their plans.  Hillary would have continued the process of making the US fall In Strength and power and continue the destructive policies put in place by the last 4 presidents.  People are ignorant and can't see past their own nose.  It's a plan that will cause the US to become insignificant and more like a 3rd world country.   Look around, Europe and Canada are on their way","81":"A special council works for a year to indict internet trolls. \nHow much money has this cost so far?\n\"No allegations of collusion.\"\n\"No allegations that ANY American had ANY knowledge.\"\n\"No evidence that their actions changed the outcome of the election.\"\n#nothingburger","82":"To hear poor demented shep smith on fox he's so disappointed, by tthe Rosenstein report .he was hoping it would say trumps campaign colluted with the russians. Poor ol' Shep.he has to eat crow along with CNN and MSNBC.hope they are enjying it.","83":"Somebody is sure touchy about this subject! His family and friends went to visit with Russia didn't they? Facebook and Google have admitted that Russia used them to promote Donald and apparently Bernie and disavow Hillary. He won by just enough Electoral votes. Now he says that Russia didn't have any effect on the election. \nI guess maybe I would be touchy also. That is if I believed in facts that is!","84":"Wow.... this isn't all about you.  A hostile foreign power attacked our election system in an effort to undermine our democracy and our government institutions.  One could argue this was an act of war.  And yet you've done absolutely nothing... nada... to ensure that this doesn't happen again. Whether or not you colluded 1) remains to be seen and 2)  doesn't change the fact that it occurred.  #sad","85":"I voted for you because the other choices were not something a person in their right mind could even think about--and I voted correctly-the more dirt that comes out about liberals the choice I made was the correct one--Russia had nothing to do with my vote but the dumb choice that ran against you did---after 8 years of Obama and the thought of another Clinton OMG no other choice!!!","86":"Thank God, but all of us normal people knew you were innocent.  Now can we finally put this bogus investigation behind us and Make America Great Again!!!!!","87":"Thinking people already knew this.  Now forget DACA, tax money going to other countries, mandate e verify, end visa lottery and chain migration and for the love of God.............REPEAL Obamacare!","88":"WHAT campaign???  You've been saying for months that there was no proof that Russia did anything? Now you say they did?  Or is this just another witch hunt and the Russians are being set up? Your bullcrap denials are getting hard to keep track of. And...btw....Rosenstein didn't say \"no collusion\" - he said these indictments don't prove any.  No one said the investigation is done. How's Rick Gate's doing...?","89":"Funny how you were in Russia in 2013 for the miss usa pageant  and met with some of the same people that was in Jr.s  office with the meeting on dirt on Hillary.. who are you kidding here,, the investigation is not over yet dummy","90":"A foreign power interfered with our elections and all you can do is think about yourself?\n\nYou're the President. Act like it.","91":"Wrong! Trump personal are already indited,only more indictments to come! Has Trump  already srarted implementing  the Sanctions on Russia for interfering in our election,he has to start with this proof!","92":"I'm sorry, wasnt it trump who called this a russioan hoax, didnt believe his own DOJ and disparaged them dividing everyone once again?  Where is Sarah Sanders memo coming from?  Deflection, deflection!  He cant admit he is ever wrong, himself!  Makes him a loser and anyone defending him one too!","93":"Not your week huh? Stormy can talk about the affair now, because your lawyer opened his big mouth. A grieving mother screamed at you, because all you want to do is send thoughts out. #EarnThatNRAMoney Appeals court stopped your #MuslimBan again. And now the Russian investigation is getting even closer. #MAGA","94":"god bless the russians helping u mr trump to be president of USA to be a part of the USSR together to attack democrats and republicans and bring gullotines to slice obama hilary and soros's heads off for punishments for terrorizing USA those 3 must be put to death","95":"We need to make our schools safe. It is all about priorities. Maybe instead of wasting money on a border wall we can make our schools safe for our children, by providing campus police, cameras, fences, etc, at all schools. If we can make Universal Studios safe, then we can make our schools safe. \n\nAlso maybe instead of giving money to Pakistan, and Egypt, and other countries, we should give that money to our schools, and towards helping homeless Veterans, and towards helping our other homeless people, and towards providing healthcare for all Americans, etc. It is all about priorities.\n\nSalute,\n\nTony V.","96":"You should care that Russia is trying to interfere with our country's democracy. Its Not about you .... it's about the future of our country. You should be clear that we won't tolerate it and take action. Rather than whining about when it started. You are the President right? Act like it\n Anti US campaign! Why doesn't that make you mad","97":"When I say you people, I don't mean everybody. MAGA, we know there was no Russian involvement with you Mr.Trump. We also assume that Russia is always doing something we don't like. Doesn't America do that?","98":"And the liberal heads will now begin to implode and say this is a distraction from a school shooting....lol....most of the country has known this for a year. When will the liberals catch up?....Cant wait to see their reaction when Clinton and Obama's indictments are handed down...","99":"Mueller is trying to find a soft place to land. Saw this coming a mile away. Indict a few Russians with no hope of prosecution with vague allegations about \"social media\" that will never be proven. Expect a couple more of these nothingburgers in coming weeks. Then a big fanfare flop nothingburger ending after the 2018 midterms.","100":"President Trump, please start today the firings of upper echelon of FBI, DOJ and State Dept. and urge a special Grand Jury be formed immediately. Please don't let another couple days go by before you take decisive, historical action against the true culprits of your proposed demise. Please President Trump, act now.","101":"So, How many of Our lawmakers are involved in the so call \"Collusion\"? There seems to be an awfully lot of fingers pointing at the POTUS. I would be willing to bet most of the ones that backed the Clintons to return to the Whitehouse also have signed autographs of the President of Russia. Since the \"socialist agenda\" was, and still is, pushed from the Dems side of the house. State of the Union address unmasked all that stood for America. Not many Dems stood so We the People know who is for America and who supports Socialism.","102":"Ever notice Russia never accuses the US in Interfereing with there Elections even though we have done it openly for several decades. Our Media and Politicians have demonized Putin a long time. Why have they not accused. O because they know in the end It does not sway the people. But Hillary did every time she spoke she said she was going put put Millions of Americans out of work.Coal Minors Steel Workers. And the Libs in can not figure out why Steel workers in Mich and Wis and Penn would vote Trump and Coal Miners in the east.","103":"Russia did not influence my vote.  I voted for the person that would do a better job.  I have no regrets and we'll vote again in 2020 for Mr. Donald J. Trump.","104":"You're so concerned about yourself that when these indictments were announced this is what you tweeted?  Instead of acting like a President of a country where it was just proven that Russia rigged our election?  Shouldn't your comments have something to do with investigating ways to ensure that this doesn't happen again?  Oh, don't know what I'm thinking, you never act like the President of this country, why start now!","105":"Sorry, 13 indictments say otherwise, but keep feeding your minions this nonsense narrative! They are gullible enough to believe anything that comes out of your lying mouth!","106":"Should we assume this was the first and ONLY attempt...why the fixation with THIS election only?! And, say, what happened to Obama telling Putin to \"cut it out!: And why--if it's such a serious. concern--would Obama then allow them to control 20% of our uranium....approved by some of the same culprits in this deep state corruption? What gives?","107":"If you didn't do anything wrong, you don't even need to explain anything, Mr President. If Russia did not exist they would bring China or any other country they seem appropriate. Just it looks like Democrats, CIA and FBI are paid from one pocket.","108":"You\u2019re right in that all their meddling, it did you no good. Hillary Clinton still got almost 3 million more votes than you.","109":"The Russians learned how to interfere with elections from Obama when he interfered with Israel's elections... way to go Obama","110":"Good morning sir,your the best President ever!! Everyone is acting so innocent!! The CIA,FBI,and all our other Intel departments have done the same thing to other country's since the cold war in the 50's,Have a great day!!!","111":"Yeah the Russians didn't make me vote for Trump. His promise to build a wall and deport illegal taco n*ggers did. Putin was already cutting checks for me cause I was involved in the propaganda wing of the alt-right.","112":"Is that a \"yes\" and FINALLY acceptance that Russia meddled in our election? The collusion thing is still an open question; we hear your position.","113":"How could Russia influence the election when the entire time, the US   lead media predicted that Trump was going to lose???  And he still WON!!!","114":"These indictments are merely noise to distract the American public from the REAL issue......H. Clinton\u2019s relationship with the Russian government ....... ZERO has been done to look into Uranium 1.........wonder why ?  \ud83d\ude44","115":"Funny, they go after Trump for colluding with Russia, they talk of impeaching and prison.  They spend millions and find he did not collude with Russia.\n  Hillary Clinton and the DNC admit to hiring multiple foreign agents to go after Trump but that is just \"opposition research\" because they used a middle man.","116":"Maybe if the DOJ wasn't concentrating so hard on fitting unrelated prices into the Russia collusion story they might have been able to actually have stopped the school shooting..","117":"Yaaaaaaaaaa President Trump.  We support you and never thought you were involved in any collusion.  You won the election and Dimms just can\u2019t stand it.","118":"...I saw the Rosenstein press conference - my immediate take was that he is starting an exit strategy because the evidence is getting uncomfortably close to other deep state members....","119":"And yet you run away . You hop on our taxpayer funded aircraft, to your own property, charge us taxpayers an arm and a leg. For what? For you to run and hide. You are a coward.","120":"The Russians had no influence whatsoever on my vote!\nPresident Trump didn't need Russia to win The Election. He had the Grassroots of America, and we're still here!","121":"In a statement that is sending shockwaves through the political world, a spokesman for General Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe announced on Friday that the counsel's 37-page indictment of Russians and Russian entities for interference in U.S. elections does not contain any allegation against any American for knowingly participating in the meddling.\n\n\"There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,\" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at a press conference on Friday.","122":"Yep, we spent millions on an investigation to Indict people that will never be charged because they will never come to America..  \n\nBuild the WALL..  #Buildthewall","123":"Anyone with a brain (excludes all Democrats) knows it's nothing but fake news. PS nice formal pics of the Obama's (snickering).","124":"The media was not fooled by anything.  They knew the truth the whole time, but the truth does not get ratings.  Lies, shock drama, fake news and distortation of the truth gets ratings.","125":"I am wondering how many Politicians were influenced by the Russian Involvement ? Because I certainly wasn't I am pretty sure we Americans know exactly how to vote and who to vote for, and we voted for you :)","126":"Although I'm sure Russia did their part in stirring up some trouble, this sounds suspiciously like more cover up for what the Democrats were doing to undermine the election.  More investigations, please!","127":"Reading the indictment was hilarious! They say Russians did the hashtags #NeverHillary #HillaryforPrison and #Trump2016 etc. Pure comedy! Russia story has collapsed.","128":"No you are correct sir you did not do anything wrong Mr. President!!! But there is huge corruption and there are huge crimes that Mueller and his deep state boys and girls have been covering up!!! Don't let him make a deal that because you are exonerated for doing nothing ...that they get a free pass on all their crimes!!!!!","129":"The leftist russia scam is focused on digging up anything to hurt Donald J. Trump, those of us with brains know this...I am guessing we will be waiting another 100 yrs before those pigs on the left see jail.","130":"The Mueller investigation has been going for 8 months now and all they can find is 13 Russians who tried to mess with us.  Liberals:  I still think Trump colluded with Russia","131":"Barrack Obama allowed this to happen! Obama only did something after HILLDABEAST lost the election - Then it becomes a problem, expels diplomats then activates the deep state to use it against Trump.","132":"The leftists have been claiming that Trump colluded with the Russians but yet they have not produced one single piece of solid evidence to back up that claim. This whole investigation was just a tantrum because the democrats didn't get the results they wanted in the election.","133":"You do not have to justify yourself. You did nothing wrong. Your election is God's choice because the God wanted to prevent those psychopaths to start a nuclear war with Russia and destroy this beautiful planet.","134":"The FBI,  CIA,  and Homeland Security disagreed with you.  President Obama disagrees with.  President Clinton disagrees with you.  The more you deny it the guiltier you sound.  TRAITOR! What does Russia have on you?","135":"I always know that!  I just hate how it is so corrupt!  Today I said with the shootings CNN stop talking about Russia just then a new Flash! The FBI needed a coverage to get heat off them!\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6","136":"Russia did indeed filtrate social media. I was informed by Twitter last month that Russia had joined feed and was following me and others . They closed my account!","137":"Just because Russia may have started something in 2014  does not prove that you or your campaign are innocent, maybe they just found the stooge they needed and convinced him to run...","138":"Russia didn\u2019t make me vote for you, the shenanigans the RNC did to you, along with what the democrats did to said, plus HRC being an evil vile human being did.","139":"Russia made me vote for Trump in the sense that I didn't want Hillary to start World War 3 with them by blowing their planes out of the sky... Does that make me a Russian Bot?","140":"Russia interfering  with our elections is nothing compared to our own USA knucklehead officials interfering in our own elections, trying to get the favorite Queen Bee elected. No luck for them, even with all the distractions, our POTUS Trump won despite all the outside interference..","141":"I think I'll wait to hear what Mueller has to say regarding collusion when he's done with his investigation.  With that said, if they were running an anti-US campaign since 2014, then the results of the election were likely impacted in some shape or form.  I would think you would be thrilled that the special investigator assigned by your DOJ is getting to the bottom of this!","142":"We all knew since the beginning there's no collusion with your campaign and the famous story of Russia. The Democrats keep hanging still the same Russia story and keep wasting our task dollar money and more investigation. I don't understand why they don't give up there's nothing there there. People have brains so use it for more productive outcome like fight for the well of this country.","143":"This is just the tip of the iceberg!  Your turn should come around the 2018 election, better get your rounds of golf in while you can!  BTW, why haven't you signed the Russia sanctions bill????????  Start worrying about our country instead of your lying tweets!","144":"Hillary .. Obama ..Hollywood... journalists.. All put their money in the pot for hillary..They had no understanding that Americans would rise up and put someone in who loves this land! A bought and paid for election and they still lost..My vote was for the man who would drain the swamp and MAGA\u2764 And I will vote for him again..Continue On Mr. President sir\u2764","145":"There was nothing in the announcement today that we didn't already know. The Russians started their campaign many years ago and today many socialists in America are aligned more with Communism than with our way of life. They have bought into the socialism party and where do you think that came from. We still want to know how Russia got our uranium and why the Clinton Foundation took so much money out of Russia.","146":"Reassuring the FBI can spend millions on pee pee dossier but couldn't investigate a murderer using his real name in Florida.","147":"You went to Russia in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant. You walked into the dressing room of these women and ogled at them, and then boasted about it later. While you were there you met with Russian oligarchs to try to open a Trump Tower on their dime. The same dime which has been pouring into your family businesses since at least 2008. One of your brilliant sons boasted about that on national tv time and time again. You've been involved with Russia for many many years, and we as Americans know it. No indictments made today on your involvement; but I have a hunch this is just the beginning of the end for you. The Russian involvement in our 2016 election was not a hoax, and you wouldn't be screaming that it was if you weren't involved in helping them know which states to target. I'm just an average American citizen with a brain that can connect the dots. Buckle up buttercup. Mueller is just getting starting.","148":"I'm finding that Shepard Smith is just a little too joyful at today's indictment of the Russians. By the year 2000 I was firm in my commitment to NEVER vote for Hillary Clinton for anything~!  The Russians had NOTHING to do with my vote against her.","149":"They know that ,they just want to distract from what the FBI did to meddle in the election , also Hilliary stealing debate questions is meddling in the election tbh","150":"The democrats will never accept they will be like the definition of insanity saying the same thing over and over to find a different result","151":"When the law finally does its job and the right thing and start indicting the Clintons, than that will be news I want to hear.","152":"Then why all of the fuss from you and the obstruction from Nunes? Certainly nothing to hide, right?\n\nWhy have you blocked the sanctions on Russia even though a bipartisan Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass them to punish Russia for their interference?","153":"High taxes from Democrat politicians over my lifetime caused me to NOT vote for HilLIARy. Unless Russia has some influence on local tax policy, I would have to say that they had little to no influence on me. \n\nP.S. I live in crook county, Illinois, so I know a little about high taxes.","154":"The results of the election were because American citizens are tired of democrat\/liberal policies and the socialistic agenda! We want strong leadership and for America to take its place back as THE top power! If Russia meddle a little - well thank you Russia!! TRUMP 2020!","155":"Russia was never thought about when I decided to vote for Trump.  They won't be in my thoughts if I get a chance to vote for him again.  I do not agree with him on everything, but I don't EVEN believe in abortion, and the destruction of our country.","156":"!7 people were just massacared the other day and its still all about him and how mean everyone is to him..Just for once shut the hell up and actually lead this country and do something positive for these poor families...They really could care less about Russia..How petty are you?..Either help these people or shut the hell up","157":"Not interested in Russia....why not focus on the school shooting that took place yesterday??? NRA got your tongue much?? Unbelievable!!!!","158":"I never thought there was collusion with you and Russia. Glad we can finally put this behind and get on with MAGA.","159":"In the face of indisputable evidence that Russia meddled in the US election and continues to do so, trump ignores the danger this poses to the US by taking no action in response to stop and prevent this, and focuses only his personal story. He only cares about himself. Shouldn't the president care about protecting the primary democratic instrument (fair elections) of the USA from a hostile foreign power?","160":"The ads placed by 13 russians on twitter and fb were not partisan. They were as much for Clinton, Black Lives Matter as they were for Trump. The purpose was to create division.","161":"Never had a doubt, I proudly voted for President Trump in both the primary and general election! Praying he\u2019ll run again in 2020 as I\u2019ll definitely vote for him again. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8","162":"I voted for Trump because he was the better candidate. Russia had nothing to do with anything on it. I had Trump figured at my 1st choice when he was among 16 hopefuls on a stage, at the start","163":"Trump: after reading the entire indictment tonight; one of two things happened...either you are UP TO YOUR EYEBALLS WITH BEING COMPLICIT...or you have been DUPED BY RUSSIA FOR YEARS!","164":"Beating around the bush and black mailing peoples minds! Trump after all you are president but collabrated with Russia","165":"I love all the people on here deluding themselves that Mueller is finished, glossing right over the fact that for over a year, Trump has claimed that Russian interference on his behalf was a hoax. Did you guys even read the indictment? I know Trump did not, it is too long. It spells out very clearly that Russian operatives actively worked to influence the election to go for Trump. It also spells out very clearly that members of the Trump campaign unknowingly helped them. So while there is no \u2018Trump campaign colluded with Russia purposefully\u2019 in these indictments, it is clear when you read the whole thing instead of taking Trump\u2019s word for it or parroting some Fox News talking points, it is clear that contrary to Trump\u2019s repeated statements that Russian interference is a hoax, that it is no hoax. And dream on about Mueller being finished! Whether he meant to or not, Mueller has just played a powerful hand. Now, if he fires Mueller, he is firing the guy who is getting the Russians out of our elections. Do you want them involved in our elections? I sure don\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying Russians tipped it for Trump. But these indictments sure make it clear that they tried very hard. Every patriotic American should be very concerned about THE FACT that Russia hacked our election. Successfully or not is debatable. Whether Trump people knowingly helped or were too stupid to know they were helping, as these indictments point out, is also still up in the air because . . . Mueller ain\u2019t done. So whose side are YOU on? Are you pro-foreign powers trying to influence our elections, or are you against that? Go read the entirety of the indictments and then tell me I\u2019m wrong.","166":"President Trump, I think the opposite is closer to the truth. To me it seems, that the unelected US- deep state started the anti-Russia campaign, so that Russia does not get too much influence over Europe, and especially not to friendly with Germany.","167":"I make up my own mind who to vote for after I pray and give much thought to who is going to do a good job for our country. Russia had nothing to do with my vote it was solely the candidates and their platforms","168":"OK Donald J. Trump no collusion. We waiting on the financial ties, money laundering and obstruction charges. Good luck with that.","169":"The indictment only states there was Russian interference with our election, which you always said is a hoax...  This does not vindicate you and does not state there was no collusion.  \n\nTIME TO USE THE RUSSIA SANCTIONS!","170":"The more dear President of the United States Donald J. Trump you are explaining to much of yourself the more the people getting looped of and with it. \n\nMost people know about the old behaviour,  also those who were deeper tied to it,  even the Hon President of Russia Vladimir Putin by himself. \n\nBest would be to move the own states crisis solvement way!\n\nBR\n\nEnrico Philipp","171":"We know you didn't. Only the haters can't believe it. I can honestly say, Russia didn't make me vote for you. My disgust for Hillary did. I'm glad I voted for you. You made a lot of changes that aren't benefiting us in the South. The job explosion is something else. God bless.","172":"How is it in one breath they say that without a doubt, the Clinton's payed Christopher Steele for fabricated dossiers about Trump, which were used to obtain warrants, was purchased from a company that has direct ties to Russia in an attempt to sway the election and then in another breath they say that \"no Americans took any part in the Russian election rigging?\"","173":"Mueller is trying to save face.  Indictments mean nothing in this case.  All those indicted are in Russia and will never be extradited for trial.  What's more whatever they did had zero effect on the election.  There were no damages to anyone so BFD .","174":"It was attempt to discredit you,cause Russia manipulated just fine before,but they knew they will not be able to do it with you,Mr.President!No one who is,sane believe Putin or lies.","175":"Nobody over the age of 40 would allow social media to sway their vote.  We older folks trust only what the candidates say.  Sorry Russia.","176":"I didn't need any help from Russia to help me decide to vote for Donald Trump. He is the first president since Ronald Reagan that has put the best interests of the citizens our nation first!","177":"I am so sick of hearing about this Russia crap! The more they dig the more obvious it is that it's the Dems who colluded with them not you! And they even have Obama telling the Russian on open mike he'd have more room to act after the election during his first term. Clearly HE was working with them before 2014!","178":"Mr. President, 2 of the indicted Russians were able to enter U.S. on travel visas which they received after applying for them through the State Dept in 2014. \n\nFrom June 4, 2014 - June 26, 2014 they traveled around the US. \n\nThe head of the FBI & State Dept at this time was John Kerry and JAMES COMEY!","179":"I suspect they, the Russia, and others have been at it longer than 2014.  It\u2019s only going to get worse moving forward.  Now some food for thought.  Which countries have we been involved in influencing the outcome for leadership.  Hmmmm do some research.","180":"Right, if the FBI would do their job, children in a church in Texas getting shot up, might not have happened. High school children in Florida might still be alive. They need to start paying attention to real threats!! Not rumors of Trump and Russia. It's been over a year. They need to s**t or get off the pot already.","181":"Trumplethinskin is going down for money laundering not collusion. The Russians were so good at creating fake accounts, rallies and peddling lies, even White House retweeted their posts. Trumplethinskin still has not put the sanctions on Russia, even though the Senate voted to enforce them, wonder why? He would lose money.  Can't wait until he is arrested\ud83d\udca9","182":"\ud83d\uded1Well with the news out of the FBI today there's only one possible response- \n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\nand it looks like you commielibs that laughed at Trump's post finally got it right for a change! Good for you!","183":"Bill for sanctions against Russia passes the house and Senate and reaches you and you don't sign it, that's the problem.","184":"Russia had no influence on my VOTING for Donald J Trump.  However my governments actions over the last 47 years has.  And this continued bias against the person I voted for only makes me want to vote for him again in 2020.  Thanks for proving I voted for the right candidate","185":"Russia had no impack on my voting for Trump, What he will do to fix America did, and What Hillary stood for helped in that as well..no one loses 33,000 e-mails when told by FBI to turn them over and gets away with it..She has had a career of doing such things..just sickening..","186":"Im sure Russia started nothing. God knows why anyone is accepting this rubbish. More like the CIA etc working for the Clinton campaign has come up with this conspiracy. We know the CIA has a sordid history of interfearing in elections in various countries including its own i.e the USA.","187":"Sir, then please let The Mueller Investigations go uninterrupted. You are vehemently saying you nor any of your people colluded. Let the investigation prove your statements. Also please give direction to prevent  access in future elections by Russia or any other foreign power!","188":"Some of the people who are saying that Russia did not influence how they voted are the very ones who were posting - and believing - the false information that Russia was spreading online. So yes, Russia DID influence you. It also shows just how gullible you were, and illustrates your unwillingness \/inability to fact check anything.  You were more than ready, willing and able to be DUPED.","189":"LOL you people are positively bananas. No such conclusion has been reached, Trump is still under investigation. The only thing we know for certain is that Russia meddled in the election and ultimately tried to sway it in Trumps favor.","190":"We know this. I can\u2019t believe the democrats wasted all those tax payer dollars. By the way who all got paid for this witch hunt???","191":"Excuses do nothing to protect our democratic process.  Actions do.  Please take action against Russia immediately and protect our democratic process from further manipulation by foreign entities.","192":"\"It\u2019s worth thinking about what a patriotic president would have done in Trump\u2019s situation. He would be leading the investigation himself. He would be scouring his own campaign\u2014doing everything in his power to reassure the country that whatever the Russians may or may not have done, his government owed Putin nothing. He would have imposed penalties on Russia for their outrageous acts\u2014rather than protecting Russia from penalties voted by Congress. Above all, he would be leading the demand for changes to election laws and practices, including holding Facebook to account for its negligence.\"","193":"13 Russians indicted for having Facebook\/Twitter accounts? So when is Facebook\/Twitter going to be indicted too? Will they be indicting all those who have Facebook\/Twitter accounts and voted for Trump too? LOL","194":"Hey Jon .. Udo Ulfkotte .. the chap below is only the former editor of the largest newspaper in Germany. You may want to apply caution and judgement as my brother was killed in the South African Army and in a war that was not of our making. You have sons and war with Russia is coming .... perhaps you need to investigate and research the motivation for war as it is never as we think it is ... almost always it is clouded in elite corporate interests who make a mint out of our collective ignorance. This war with Russia is entirely avoidable given that folks investigate, research and know. Start with why Glen Beck was fired from Fox and then look at the fact that the US has been at war for 214 years and peace for 21 years since its inception in 1776 ... perhaps with knowledge we the people of this planet can avoid the chaos and carnage that impacted our parents.","195":"The question is not so much about the election as it is about a relationship with our enemy that works against America's interests.  For example, Congress by huge margin passed sanctions on Russia BUT they aren't being implemented by an administration that has had private business with Russian leaders and known  criminals.  Now tell me that doesn't look questionable?  Tell me that the gravity of such a situation doesn't warrant a complete investigation","196":"If the democrats didn't start with the russia probe that took a part of the FBI out of service, to look into this bogus theme of Trump and Russian spys, maybe just maybe Mueller's team might of stopped the school shootings. Think about it.","197":"2014, a year after Trump started a presidential exploratory committee. Everyone and anyone except for Trump is saying Russia meddled in our elections. No collusion. Guess we'll find out, nothing to hide besides tax returns, right?","198":"No Russia didn't force me to vote for you Mr. POTUS that's for sure..I'm just a Latina woman who wanted to do her part in MAGA","199":"I keep seeing comments about putting sanctions on Russia and I can't help but wonder what kind of chaos would ensue. Until a crazy little North Korean is under control, why would anyone think pissing off Russia too is a good idea? Who do you think would be more than willing to give NK uranium? Putin could let NK do his dirty work and never push the button.","200":"I do not use social media to decide how I'm going to vote. People who do are not well informed on the candidates running. So, Russia had absolutely no affect on my decision to vote for Trump! He is the candidate that had the platform that I identified closely with. A well informed voter looks at the candidate and the position he takes on the issues important to them not social media.","201":"Weird, because when companies announced new hires in 2015 before you announced you were running for president, you still took credit for them...\n\nAnd just because russia started earlier doesn't mean your campaign didn't collude. In fact, your son already said he met with the russians - 'who control a disproportionate amount of your assets' according to him - to try to get dirt on Clinton.","202":"Russia may have started their US campaign in 2014, but they must have colluded with you to run for President promising you that they would help you win. Not all of us are fooled and the truth will be revealed in due time.","203":"Obama should have been investigated on Russian collusion,they waited for you, and never would have mentioned it if clinton won.  And also guns have been around for centuries why is now the time these kids are coming out shooting let's go with all the pills they take  for depression etc.  look how out of control they were when  you won the election ... the kids are out of control and it is mental illness not gun control!","204":"You've got to be kidding.  Everything you said during the campaign was completely in sync with the Russian hacking.  And why haven't you carried out the sanctions against Russia that Congress voted for?  And why aren't you concerned that all your intelligence chiefs testified under oath last week saying that Russia is already interfering with the 2018 election?","205":"7 million dollars later to tell us something we already knew. Russia had no influence on my vote. Keep moving forward President Trump on making our country great again. One year in and things are looking a lot brighter for hard working Americans.","206":"Every country (especially the United States ) tries to influence other countries election oh heck the US  tries to over throw (backing) governments. now if Russia or any country actually physically changes our election results that's a different story.  what about the hot mike with Obama telling a Russian official that he will be in a better position after his election looks whose all chummy with Russia","207":"I thought Russia wasn't involved at all? That's what you have been claiming for a year now is it not?\nLiars always change their story.","208":"Contacts wirh Russia were made through Christopher Steele, Sidney. Blumenthal, and other Dems. Russians provided false info to the Dems. Russian collusion, yes, but with the Dems. The evidence speaks for itself. Their collusion did not swing votes toward Donald J. Trump. He won the election fair.and square.","209":"All of you folks claiming Russia didnt influence your choice in the 2016 election,  think again. If you believed in pizza gate, you were duped by a bunch of RUSSIANS. Thats just one example there are dozens more","210":"A guy that has to defend himself publicly on social media just shows how guilty he is haha. You shut down all investigations against you....... so called president. \ud83d\ude02","211":"OK. So what we know from that paragraph of the charging documents is this:\n\nBy \"early to mid-2016,\" Russians had decided to use whatever means at their disposal to help Donald Trump win.\nThe Russians bought political ads on social media sites and organized political rallies to achieve those goals.\nRussians, disguising their identities, \"communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump campaign\" in an attempt to \"coordinate political activities.\"\nNone of that is a smoking gun of collusion.\n\n\"Unwitting\" members of Trumpworld working with Russians, who didn't identify themselves as Russians, is not the same as a willful effort on behalf of members of the Trump campaign to actively collude with the Russian government.\n\nBut what this latest set of indictments proves beyond a shadow of a doubt is that, yes, Russia staged an aggressive and elaborate effort to influence the 2016 election.","212":"As today liberals can't assume and accept they lost the elections and they try to find someone guilty. The issue is the liberals have been used the alluded Russia' collusion as a token to spend time, resources and federal money to justify their salaries.","213":"So this has been going on since 2014, the other administration did nothing about it other then try to use it to bring down Trump. We would probably never know about it if the other one won. Maybe this is what they call insurance?","214":"Mainstream media finally found something and it almost took their breath completely away.  I have never seen such excitement elicited by so many people at once.  They were totally beside themselves.  They found something!  Not sure they know what it is but it sure set them on fire.  However, I don\u2019t think they found what they were looking for, but to find anything was almost too much for them to take.  I kept waiting for Trump\u2019s collusion with Russia to surface\u2026. but alas I heard nothing about that.  Could it be that they did not find what they wanted?  Then I think they realized everything came out before Trump ever ran for president.  Oh my!  What next?   Stay tuned!  Now will someone please start the ball rolling on Soros, Clinton, Obama and anyone else connected to all the garbage that has surfaced.  Most of us are tired of that \"all smoke and no fire\" thing.  Washington should have been far ahead of all this stuff that just surfaced.  Time to s** or get off the pot as we used to say.  I am getting angry!  Don't know about anyone else.","215":"I think we all know that the whole Russia thing is the Dems covering up their crimes, doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out !!","216":"Then testify before mueller and prove your innocence. I for one believe you and just about everyone in Washington are guilty of collusion with Russia.","217":"The Witch Hunt inference is used to describe the Collusion investigation not the Russian election meddling investigation. Everyone, including Oh Bummer, knows Russia interferes in our elections. In fact, Oh Bummer had evidence in 2014 and took no action? Can the Dems explain that?  #MAGA   #AmericaFirst","218":"STOP TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA. We have kids dead and injured in hospitals and here you are tweeting like an a** hole. Oh and btw thanks for the gun regulations I\u2019m glad to know you and your dumb party think gun restrictions are above children\u2019s lives. Smh we should never have elected you","219":"Sir, what do you plan to do to prevent foreign interference in the future?  Your continued denial and inaction to implement sanctions against Russia leads one to believe you may be compromised in some way.  Americans want a strong independent leader who stands against such interference.","220":"Mueller IS NOT done yet Donald Trump,  so NOBODY should ever claim innocence yet! With that said,  Donald Trump...YOU are OUR President, Russia invaded our democracy on OUR soil, INSIDE OUR country...DO SOMETHING...DEFEND OUR COUNTRY for Christ sakes, OR are you really that weak?","221":"No Trump-Russian collusion, yet plenty of Democratic\/FBI-Russian collusion. The new head of the FBI needs to start cleaning house yesterday if he plans on restoring any integrity to his beloved organization. Christopher Wray needs to get off his high horse and admit that the FBI screwed up the Florida shooting case and housed treasonous officials that interfered with the Trump presidency. The FBI is the perfect example of a bureaucratic quagmire.","222":"You should look into Igor Panarin prediction for US Civil War.  He basically sets out the strategy for breaking up America. Acknowledge what Russia is doing to make US citizens to be pitted against each other and start unifying this country.","223":"I already predicted you would try to spin it this way. Keep thinking that..... While you continue to lie to the public, Mueller is still coming after YOU!","224":"All that says is Russia was not doing this for a particular person, the just wanted to interfere with our election process. They got a bonus when Trump decided to run. Russia knew they could play this joke of a man like a puppet.","225":"Every time Hillary opened her mouth to speak she lost my vote! There wasn\u2019t a Russian on the face of this earth that made me vote for President Trump! Her lies, deceit did though! MAGA","226":"Truth be told....Russia has been meddling in every election since probably Kennedy and before! What\u2019s so  unusual about that? If our government was honest...they have probably done the same thing. This is not new news.....it\u2019s reality! \nIt is time to move on!!!!","227":"Haha, we find out that the whole \u201cRussia Trump Collusion\u201d was bought for by Clinton and a fake dossier was used to get a FISA warrant and 2 Days later Russians are charged and nothing to see here, move along!? Convenient?! They are just HOPING They will not have charges against them for this whole Clinton paid witch hunt...","228":"Russian Government would have known a Clinton presidency would have resulted in swift military action directed at russia.the deep state had been fermenting war on russias borders Syria and Ukrain.#winning the deep state war with trump","229":"These are two separate issues.  Russia meddling\/interfering with the election and collusion between them and the Trump campaign.  Even if the latter is false, the former still needs to be addressed and dealt with.","230":"Though that may be true, I'm definitely still waiting for the day trump actually says what Russia did was bad or even somewhat slaps them on the wrist for what they did. Defending them is definitely not the best look.","231":"Mr. President, the only way the luberals can guarentee future negotiations with Russia, by your administration,  will fail.. is to continue this falicy that Russian collusion is your fault.. I belueve you think Russia can be a powerful US ally once again. The Dems just want to guarentee you fail in making that happen...","232":"It just seems kinda funny that they are announcing all this TODAY... the same day we find out that THEY FAILED with the killings in Florida.... they were informed.... and they did nothing about it.","233":"Obviously.  People are just obsessed with hating Russia and want to make it harder for us to make stronger ties with them.  A better relationship with Russia is beneficial, but some don't want that.","234":"I don't know why people are laughing, they were the ones who blindly believe Democrats and their pet Media about Trump colluding with Russia, now here we are, over a year later and guess what, Muller just confirmed what we already knew, Trump wasn't involved. Yet again Democrat voters got played, I would think you guys would get tired of the democrats lying to you yet you keep coming back like a battered wife, sad but whatever.","235":"Is it only wrong to commit a crime if it has an effect? Is it ok to steal from stores that have shrink budgeted in...because they\u2019ve already planned to lose the money, so there\u2019s no impact? Should Russia not be dealt with for their attempt? Should anyone who helped them, whether it worked or not, be free from prosecution? Of course not.","236":"Yes, but it was soon after you went to Russia for a beauty contest.  That's probably when you and Putin decided you were going to run.  You just waited until it was a more appropriate time to announce, so it wouldn't seem connected.","237":"The Russian meddlers had NOTHING to do with 63 million voters smart enough to save our country... Trump 2020!","238":"100% in support of you Mr. President. Never doubted you. Now, I hope Mr. Sessions will open up the special investigation of collusion and violations of federal law by the Clintons, Comey, etc., etc,. etc.","239":"Putin unashamedly admitted to election interference at least a year ago in an interview with Megyn Kelly.  He also said we do the same to Russia.","240":"Suspicious how the FBI was following the Russians back in 2014 but let them get away and back to Russia. There will be no trial and the facts will be swept under the rug. The American People will never know the truth.","241":"I read the 37 page indictment. No collusion between Trump campaign and Russia. Wondering how many leftists will spout off based on spin from CNN rather than reading the documents","242":"Russia may have attempted to influence our country, but if you think Americans vote because of something said on social media then you are selling Americans short and have no faith or confidence in Americans. The division of our country is what they are after. They sow division and some fall into their trap. Democrats an liberal media continue to stir the pot and show extreme division every day. Don't let them win in 2018. They will ruin this country and they don't believe in Americans.","243":"Seriously he is so right it was in 2014 and who was the president then oh look no further obama.So people let that sink in who were the people in 2014 that were involved with Russia it was the obama and his administration come on people.","244":"You don't have any problems with Russia. Both you and MR. Putin are great leaders and the world counts on you to save the world from the neoislamisation and corrupted political systems.","245":"I too guarantee you that Russia had nothing to do with my vote. 8 years of Obama and Hillary\u2019s treasonous actions influenced my vote. This investigation has been a waste of money.","246":"Why is this about you? Grow up!  You should be condemning the actions of Russia to our democracy.  Reading these comments makes me embarrassed to be an American.","247":"I don't blame Russia either...when you have corrupt U.S. politicians handing over information wouldn't you take it??? Drain the swamp and prosecute Obama and Hillary!!!","248":"I know for a fact, that Russia had nothing to do with my decision to vote for Donald J. Trump, he is the one I wanted and I voted for him and so very glad I did and I'm very proud of him!","249":"This is all another Hillary paid distraction, \nTheir are two extreme different stories here???\nThe right believe the Russia collusion was created by Hillary to steal the presidency!!!\nThe left believe the TRUMP collusion with Russia gave him the victory???\nWe the people for TRUMP, MAGA!!!","250":"Even with ALL the illegals that voted, TRUMP still TRUMPED Hilliary -  The Russians would much rather have HER in WH because they know she's just like BHO who \"drew that line in the sand\", again and again.  Trump will protect us, just what Russia does NOT want","251":"No Sir they are starting nothing.Russia only get back the Krim no more.I do never understand why Putin do not take the whole Ukraine.This was possible for him verry easy.But on the Krim was an reverendum and the peoples say yes for Russia.","252":"The US began their anti-Russia campaign long before that. The Russians were just accurately describing what the US was doing. \n\nI think anyone who doesn't wonder if they're the bad guys are the bad guys","253":"But you now know Russia did try to interfer....so why aren't you punishing them??? How many billions of dollars do you owe them??? Still afraid to release those tax returns because we'd all know then???","254":"Exactly but now it is time for justice for all those that did collude with Russia. They are called liberals democrats and rhinos.","255":"I'm Canadian and am a Trump supporter (except the Trophy Hunting) but Russia didn't make me love Trump!!!   It's about time America has a President actually trying to help the country!!!!!!!","256":"You were INNOCENT all along.  It is absolutely outrageous that it took this long and cost millions to prove it.  Now please get rid of those in charge of the FBI who haven't been properly running the agency.  It is inexcusable those children died because the FBI FAILED TWICE to do their jobs and prevent what happened in Florida.","257":"Regarding the current charges..... Mueller is trying to buy time\/make the headlines\/keep the money rolling in to continue his witch hunt. It\u2019s all window dressing. None of the Russian nationalists will ever be brought to justice and pathetic Mueller knows it. Mr.President, please continue to breakdown the stranglehold of special interests and cronyism that is pervasive in DC.","258":"Quit worrying about your Trump campaign and realize that Russia invaded our country illegally through communication wires. Please set your ego aside for once!!!!","259":"Thank you President Trump for your honesty in addressing this issue.I know myself and many more Americans respect and understand what your vision is to restore our great country.Thank you for having the courage to accept the overwhelming responsibility that is before you.I know that I am only one voice;but I speak for many with my beliefs; my hopes in that we are encouraged by your position as our President' Thank you again and God be with you!","260":"Most of all already knew that.  We also know it was Hillary\/Obama who were colluding with the Russians and yet they are all out there yapping their mouths.  Sessions needs to get moving.  We want an investigation into the Uranium One deal.","261":"And isn\u2019t it interesting that the democrats who cried \u201cno such thing as a rigged election\u201d used \u201cRussians\u201d as a way to try to bring you down? Very interesting, indeed! Smells like Hillary to me! She too had a private server...","262":"Exactly...Russia did not force me to vote for Trump..the idea of another Clinton made me vote for Trump..and i have yet to be disappointed in him...he has been a much better choice than Hillary's campaign","263":"Hmmm how does Trump know so much about Russia in 2014??? Something sounds fishy! Keep talking you are going to tell on yourself! Some people tell their whole story themselves! \"Wow\"","264":"What did Russia do? Buy ads on Facebook? Seems our election is really easy to tamper with. Now funding opposition groups in say the middle eaat, that sounds like some real meddling.","265":"I decided to vote for Trump the same day he announced he was running for president. I loved that slogan. Make America great again. He also said he'd clean up corruption in Washington.Then he said something that secured my support for good which was \"we need to build a wall along the southern border. Russia had absolutely nothing to do with my decision to vote for president Trump.","266":"I\u2019m still trying to figure out how Russia made me wake up at 6am, drive to the polling booth, and fill in the bubble next to Trumps name. Whatever they did, it sure did work.","267":"Bottom line is America saw through the bs, lies, deceit and evil of Hillary and made a brave choice to elect a man that would put America first.  President Trump is no more perfect than the rest of us, but never once did I or will I question his love for this country and doing what is right for America, our Vets and Law Abiding Citizens.","268":"one-third of the 500 apartments he\u2019d sold went to \u201cRussian-speakers.\u201d So many bought the Trump-branded apartments, in fact, that the area became known as \u201cLittle Moscow.\u201d  Make America great or Russia.","269":"We are behind you Mr. President. You\u2019re doing a great job for us!!! Get rid of AG Sessions and get us a real Person of the Law and that will be the icing on the cake \ud83c\udf70 \n\u261d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude02\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8","270":"Please send this information to The Loudoun Times Mirror (Virginia).  They continue to run stories about Russia, even the current issue has one. Someone.must be paying them.","271":"I knew all along President Trump that you did not collude with Russia and that it was just a witch hunt on you!!","272":"So....what are you doing to condemn Russia? Why have you not implemented sanctions? You are spending a lot of time defending yourself, rather than defending our nation against a foreign adversary...","273":"I\u2019m an Iranian immigrant who came to United States of America LEGALY! I became a Naturalized US Citizen a few years ago and I\u2019m not a Russian bot! I proudly voted for President Donald  J. Trump and Russia had no influence on my decision. By the way, I\u2019ll be voting for President Donald J. Trump in 2020 again!","274":"Time to charge Soros for doing the same thing and the DNC uses msm like CNN and MSNBC etc. to change the minds and outcomes of elections ...time to round them up and charge them with the same crimes they're charging the Russians with..","275":"The date that it DID start is interesting - almost immediately after you got back from that beauty pageant in Moscow. You know the one - it's where some of the most salacious storied in the Steele dossier came from! And their SERIOUS push began right after your New Hampshire primary win. Curious timing, isn't that? And, since the investigation isn't over yet AND these indictments are for only one prong of Putin's Cyber Pearl Harbor, not only has there been no conclusion on your campaign's complicity with what they did, the wording of the indictment left a giant hole for further charges against as yet unnamed individuals. Like YOU. And your kids. Finally, since there's been zero forensic analysis done of the actual voter tallies, we'll NEVER know exactly how much the sabotage affected actual votes.\n\nSo, to sum up: you're STILL screwed. And I'm STILL betting that you'll be leaving the People's House in handcuffs to spend the next years of your miserable life not in your NYC bordello but in a cell, in a jumpsuit the same color as your ridiculous spray tan.","276":"The only reason why we have this with Russia was because of past Administrations one including the Obama Administration I feel with Trump as president some way we can bring it back as it was when FDR was president and Stalin was in command I know Stalin was a dictator but we were allies then and i don't see why its so bad for us to be ally of Russia it would be powerful.","277":"We all knew what the outcome would be. The funny thing is the real collusion has been exposed. I hope Rosenstein and Mueller turn their full attention to the real crooks of 2016. Hillary, Obama, Comey and others need to be investigated. Hell, the evidence is right there and it has been exposed. And there is even more coming out daily. Dilly Dilly\ud83d\udc4d","278":"I, however, denigrated the hell out of #SickHillary all throughout the campaign!!! I can't stand that decrepit old hag!!! Thank God you won!!! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain","279":"Russia had absolutely no influence in me deciding to vote for Trump.  I thank God everyday HRC is not my President.","280":"We the people knew it Wouldn't be any involvement with Russia.keep doing a great job for all the American people.","281":"After all the time and money spent on this investigation, is this all they have?  A bunch of indictments on a bunch of Russian trolls that don't mean a thing.","282":"Gotta love the left going crazy over this , Trump called it a witch hunt!  And it is a witch hunt the Trump collusion not that Russians tried to interfere,  that's no big story the Russians have been trying to interfere in US policies and politics for 50 years !!","283":"The only ones who influenced the election were Obama, HClinton, and their corrupt loyalists hijacking and abusing parts of the Federal Government, including stealing 7 Million votes from Trump, creating fraudulent votes, using illegals to boost votes for HClinton, etc.","284":"The fact that you refuse to implement the sanctions that Congress voted 517-5 to implement or condemn this act of war by Russia speaks volumes about what Putin has on you.","285":"I listened to all the candidates speak. I watched their lips move. Nothing and I mean nothing influenced my vote for trump. Hillary was a flawed candidate in many many ways. Trump was flawed too but had the principles and beliefs I agreed with.","286":"We spy on them,, they spy on us, we meddle they meddle it has been going on for decades.   Nothing new.  other then the steady anti trump marchers that repeat the same old accusations in hopes that if they say it enought it will some how become true.. :)","287":"The TRUMP TRAIN  won in a \"LANDSLIDE\" despite HRC colluding with Russia on a \"slander\" campaign against the TRUMP TRAIN, which includes me.  She sinned and trespassed against me.","288":"Mr. President, most Americans knew it was all (Russian collusion) nonsense, well, except for maybe the Russian collusion with the Democrat Party.\nKeep up the good work and stop \"compromising\" with the Liberals so much, We the People have your back!","289":"Oh donnie boy, you were paying for polls in 2013 to test the waters of a presidential run. \nYour Russian friends knew because you told them\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 \nThen they cranked up theirs operations, didn't they?.  \ud83d\ude18 \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa \ud83d\ude18\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa\nWhat do they have on you?  \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18","290":"if they'd of just voted instead would they have been ok? is Mueller now gonna go after all those illegal immigrants that carried vote for Hillary signs, or posted their support for Hillary on FB?","291":"We voted you in because we want what you stand for. Americans have their own ears and eyes and can make their own decisions.","292":"All those Russians have to do at this point in time is say they were brought in and hired by Hillary Clinton and you know Robert Mueller would drop all indictments against them overnight. That's what I would do if I was one of those Russians or those 13 Russians I would just say we were hired by Hillary Clinton","293":"Wow russia was in on a scheme to interfere with our elections. I heard they spent two-hundred thousand in ads through sneaky tactics.  How huge is that,  because Hillary spent over a billion and Trump spent a half of billion. that's 1\/7500 percent of Russian paid involvement, I think that's correct.  Maybe that's a little less important than the news industry are making it.  Russia has always been involved in our elections with their dirty tricks, haven't they? At least in my lifetime.","294":"13 Russians indicted?? I'd like to ask why the media meddles in elections by publishing lies called \"news\" & then gripes about Russian election meddling.\n\nIndict the media next!","295":"the entire complaint appears to have been written by a high school drop out. It may have been written by Clinton's attorney.--just like the dossier was.","296":"You yourself tweeted that 'the journey to #MAGA began in 2011\" at CPAC.\n\nSo while you hadn't officially announced your run, that's when you began planning it and working towards it.  And your Russian buddies knew it.","297":"Regardless of any influence Russia may of tried to have in the election, nothing would of ever convinced me to vote for Hillary Clinton.","298":"Your right Mr Trump no collusion and by the way Russia did not make us here in coal country vote for you and we thank you for our coal jobs that are roaring back thank you for helping my family","299":"Amber hillary and bill have visited russia back in the 70s \nThey are part of the pay for play, uranium one, dosier group thats the scary part - why arent they under arrest\nObamagate","300":"\"@AlferovaYulyaE: I'm sure @realdonaldtrump will be great president! We'll support you from Russia! America needs ambitious leader!\" -tweeted on 1\/22\/14 @ 4:26PM.","301":"You got to love it how we all figured it out as we listened daily to all the propaganda. Democrats, media, and Russians all created a bunch of crap which has ended up costing tax payers millions. Robert Mueller hired a bunch of monkey's who couldn't find their butt with both hands. Mueller is crooked as the day is long. He's in the bag with the Obama's and the Clinton's. Many innocent people have had their lives ruined over the made up Russia story. That has to be made right! Mueller knows he's going in circles.","302":"We already knew this. I know Russia didn't vote for me, I did that my own self. This calls for celebration and four scoops, that should put CNN over the edge this time!","303":"Great! Now that that's over with put some time and effort into addressing America's mental health crisis and giving the proper funding for treatments. Also, purchasing guns should require the same training classes, tests, and registrations that are required for obtaining a driver's license and legalizing a car. Hold people accountable and make it a little harder to walk in and purchase a gun.","304":"This is not a surprise Russia has always sought to bring down free countries\nIts their belief to turn the world to communism and millennia's dont have a clue","305":"To hell with russia!!!   #MAGA\n    CNN is in bed with russia along with the liberal left.   We The People...know this all too well.","306":"We know now by all of Mueller's work that it was the Demorats, that was in collusion with the Russians. Inditing 13 Russian's today for doing what they have done is a joke.","307":"Does it seem a little odd to anyone else that the memo was seen by the American public just recently so that we now know how \"they\" colluded with Russia against President Trump and all of his supporters and today this indictment and speech was made about what these Russians did?","308":"So it is all going to come down to the Comey memos. He insisted to meet with the President alone so there are no witnesses. He could have made all this up. #RussianCollussionDelusion","309":"Anti-US campaign???? Bro, are You serious?? ROFL. Try to help your people instead of posting lies. Russia has no interest in US at all. We have our own problems to solve.","310":"It\u2019s not hard to figure out why people voted for, and continue to support Donald Trump. It certainly had nothing to do with propaganda from Russia.","311":"Except that you were floating the idea of running since 2013 - which aligns with what was reported in the Dossier about Russia vetting you for the previous five years prior to the election. You also would not have commissioned a study to see how you would do in a presidential run - as your attorney Cohen said that you did not go through that for the study to sit in a shelf. Why not wait until the Mueller investigation is complete before asserting that there was no collusion. There is nothing to substantiate that there was no collusion at this point.","312":"What a waste of taxpayers money and investigative resources that should have been spent and directed to the recent mass shootings.  Time to lay the Russian Collusion Illusion to rest.","313":"Enact those sanctions against Russia NOW!!! If you aren't colluding it should be easy to do! Why are you letting another country meddle in our elections?","314":"I never believe any of this.  Common sense says- why would Russia want a President who wants to beef up our military?!  It\u2019s as simple as that.","315":"Priya Patel is marking everyone's comments as spam when they have valid arguments.  Guns are not the problem.  Ignoring things that make you feel uncomfortable is at the root of all violence!","316":"Sorry sir but Russia started meddling in our elections in 1920!!! We use to have a large group of communist in this country that Russia financed!!!!","317":"Yeah, that was right about the time you were in Russia for the Miss World pageant. So you've been on the Putin pyroll longer than most of us thought. Did he comp you the hookers, or did you pay cash?  Dude, we are not stupid. Give it up and head out to pasture (your lonely lfe in Trump Tower) for the last couple of years of your life.","318":"They were even targeting sanders with fake boosts so it had nothing to do with trump. Russia didnt want a clinton elected is all that happened.","319":"and yet the left still screams collusion and trump in the same sentence.  I do think trump should agree to sanction Russia.  good old shep smith got all excited and assumes trump is going down.  I had to mute him.  wish I could do more than that.  anyone got a stapler?","320":"Why didn't Obama's and Clinton's friend Putin target their campaigns(?) Remember when obozo was caught on a hot mic saying he'd have more flexibility after the election??? Hmmmmm and of course the URANIUM ONE dealings were very favorable to puttie.....something smells..","321":"If evidence against Russia is irrefutable, shouldn't we sanction Russia in some way or at least have POTUS tell us why it's not in our best interest to do so.","322":"The whole Mueller investigation is to cover up that the Obama Administration  was wiretapping American citizens. Anyone remember the RICO laws? RICO laws were enacted to go after the mafia, and overtime have become the conspiracy laws. If the Obama Administration is allowed to illegally go after an American citizen then tomorrow they will go after YOU!","323":"Also it was indicated they were also working against Bernie, but the Anti Trump Mainstream media seems to somehow have forgotten to mention that key point!","324":"I vote for Trump because He wanted to rebuild this country. Russia had nothing to do with it. Did not want a Socialist Government and open boarders.","325":"Manifort worked for Russia, took their money and gave you their playbook to call out fake news and hoax, and smear our FREE PRESS.  All clasic Russian tools to divide people.   This was collusion.","326":"I wonder if Mueller will expose all the Democrats that took money from these Russian spies, like the Obama\u2019s, the Clinton\u2019s, Lynch, holder, Comey, the top dogs at the FBI, ETC...., I don\u2019t think so, he would have to turn in most of his close buddies.","327":"Russia is allied with the Democrats indirectly. They are tools to divide the country. \nThe dems are all out for it. \nWho are really using the Russians to advance their party???","328":"You've been running for decades and because of your criminal ties to Russia and your financial obligations....they support you because of your dire incompetence and stupidity","329":"Isn\u2019t it strange that the Meuller investigation began only because Trump won??? FBI at it again deflecting big time!! Makes us wonder what are they trying to hide now???","330":"Just soooo happy to have this lying mess behind you now! They have made themselves out to be complete fools:( hmmm no wonder they are fighting so hard for illegals! Their going to need every vote they can steal! \n   I just read a poll that in the democratic poll they took,  the Dems only had a 4 pt lead among Democrats only votes! Baaa haaaa! Mr President!!!!! What have you done! Lolol \ud83d\ude02 I love it!","331":"If people use social media to make their choice of who to vote for they are idiots. It's like taking the advice of a rock star. That applies to all levels of elected officials. Do some homework, research, positions, voting records. Don't be a LIV.","332":"Mueller: \u2018Okay, here\u2019s the proof. Russian agents hacked the election.\u2019\nTrump\u2019s response: attack everybody except Russia. You are either \u2018pro Russia hacking our elections\u2019 or against. Which are you, Donald? Actions speak louder than tweets. Still blocking the implementation of Russian sanctions that have overwhelming bipartisan congressional support. It\u2019s funny how the more you scream \u2018no collusion,\u2019 the more complicit you become by doing nothing to try to stop them next time.","333":"The keystone state lead you to victory along with our lord Yeshua \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2728\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0ewe beat them fair and square !!

(For Instance)  Look at how all these liberals are acting today. They have no good sense at all. The mainstream media can influence every thought in their minds they have even if it is false and they act upon it without spending any time to find out the truth.","335":"Let's dig back to the Obama Administration to see who interfered with his election.  Someone did, not born in the US, but Kenya, among countless other things like losing his law license for illegal activity, which had to of been a crime, and falsifying his so called he\/she wife as a first lady.  On and on the list goes.","336":"President Trump, please step up and protect the USA. We need strong penalties against Russia for their crimes against us. We need to acknowledge this as a cyber war and increase our defense to prevent this from happening to this extent again.","337":"It was an opportunity for them to get someone of your caliber to spearhead their ambitions, indeed you are doing a recommendable job for RUSSIA.","338":"Funny how hard they work on Russia, but Hillary and Obama get away with murder. Also maybe if the FBI spent less time on Russia 17 people wouldn't be dead.","339":"Those of us with brains understand that and know you're right. Those out there with no brains are still having tantrums that criminal Clinton didn't win, and they're unable to process how lucky we are that we dodged that bullet.","340":"If anyone colluded with Russia it was Clinton by giving them uranium in exchange for contributing to her foundation. Why isn\u2019t anyone up in arms about that.","341":"The fbi is ran by the demi, it is quite clear of that after the FL shooting. If they would have investigated the shooter last month i feel it would have been diverted. But the Demi need to have something to start their gun law BS","342":"Even Obama said no vote ballots themselves were not tampered with. Anyone can be a journalist. Are we supposed to go to war with everyone that puts out fake news stories? No thanks. Education is the solution, not sending our troops to fight a war against memes because the left is blaming them for their election loss","343":"Agreed completely but there is more than enough real evidence that killary colluded with Russia and got a huge payday for it.","344":"Call me what you like, I voted against the globalists, establishment and deep state and voted for a man, Trump, that was and will not be controlled by them.  That loves America, the Constitution and has 'We the People' first.","345":"Myself and my family support you all the way Mr. President!  Keep doing the great job your doing and don't let the democrates, rhinos and tabloids so called news take you off course.  I keep you, your family and Vice President in my prayers.","346":"Russia started to set up shop in 2014 and progressed to shape the election once they saw who were the candidates and who would most easily be swayed to Russia's requests.","347":"Ah but...you had God on your side and still do.The God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob.The wise were confounded and you took on the mantle of  the President of the United States no easy task. And now you are exposing the greed and corruption and truly helping the country back on it's feet again.God Bless You Sir!!!","348":"But the Democrats and elite Republicans conspired with the FBI and DOJ to fix the election. And how come no one says anything about the Democrats conspiring with a foreign government to flood in Mexican nationalists to influence our sovereign elections?","349":"Russia had nothing to do with the way I voted. Now Hillary and the Democratic party...they influenced my vote to Make America Great Again!","350":"The funny thing is the Russia interference was to support Bernie,  but the Clintons other idea about who would win, and they still lost!","351":"The far left were confident Obama's take down of America would continue with Hillary in the White House. They had diabolical plans as witnessed by the corruption in the FBI and DOJ. With Almighty God's help and patriotic red blooded Americans, Donald Trump won!! Their treasonous agenda was foiled! The whole Russian collusion theory has been turned on it's face and the democrats are facing themselves in the mirror of impropriety. \"What goes around, comes around!\" MAGA!!!","352":"I voted for Trump because I liked his ideas. Russia had not one thing to do with my vote! And next term I will do the same.","353":"Ironic how the left accuses Trump of colluding with Russia, but yet are cool with all the dead people and illegals voting...","354":"Yes i cant believe they are still going with this Russia crap. Shouldn't they also be arresting half the media over there then for all the bs stories they run?","355":"Your refusal to enforce the sanctions on Russia which were voted on overwhelmingly by Congress speaks so much louder than your \"no collision\" whining.","356":"The people that voted for him wanted him in the office that he holds, the Russians had nothing to do with it. Seems to me that Democrats can't get over the fact they lost, and if they started this in 2014, and they can't tie nothing to this this man and his campaign in 2016. Now we're in 2018, and they can find no wrong doings that involved The President of the United States.

Stop passing blame and trying to make yourself look innocent of any sort of dangerous behavior. You consort with the leader of a country considered an enemy of the State and show a lax attitude toward Russia.","359":"All that proves is you waited until you had Russia on your side before declaring candidacy. Why are you so adamant that you didn't collude? If you believe in due process, the truth will set you free.","360":"before and after the election, Russia did promote aggressively to elect Donald Trump. Now the Donald is saying no collusion. Well Canada and the world knows the truth, partially from the \nMueller investigation.and Russia.","361":"Dunno why it matters our Labour leader in the UK has been proven to work for Russia as a spy against us yet he's still in office","362":"we knew that - media will never suddenly be an accurate source of information after NOT having been so for over 55 years now. Just ignore them and move on about doing jobs that are more important than responding to idiots who think life is a big, giant playpen.","363":"And how long did it take for them to come to that conclusion? And how much money did it cost? All for utter BS from the left! why is this country in so much debt?

Will you actually implement the Russian sanctions?","368":"I wonder if Mueller made his announcement on the heels of the Florida massacre so the mainstream media could ignore it.  Ditto announcing on Friday afternoon.","369":"I agree completely about 2014. But...the anti-US campaign from Russia started in 1947. With a small pause, thanks to Ronald Reagan.","370":"How much has our country influenced votes and even coups in other countries elections and governments.  It happens, but one candidate paying party finances to do it is more than wrong.","371":"What kind of response is this? You don't seem a bit outraged that a foreign country meddled in our democracy?  Is this some sort of new revelation to you?  Hiding something?  You don't seemed to be concerned at all.  Not the kind of a response from an \"innocent\" guy who claims it's a Democratic hoax and that you asked Putin if he meddled and you believed him when he said \"no\". Think about that.","372":"it was the US that started the anti-US campaign, and it was decades ago. You just blame it and everything else on Russia lol","373":"Translation,\" heading to Mar-A-Lago and will stop for great photo-op to show what a caring president I am....probably the most caring president ever.

That the \"Russian thing\" was a hoax?  \nNah. That had to be a different Donald J. Trump.","376":"At the beggining he denied Russia involvement in the 2016 US elections. Now he is accepting but arguing they acted way before his candidacy.","377":"No Russian made me vote for President Trump! I voted for Trump because he was the right person for the job at this time! The regular politicians had a hold on our government and it was no longer our country... it was the politicians! It may not be perfect but it is our country and President Trump is getting it back for us! He didn't need the job but the politicians did and it seems they did whatever it took to keep it!","378":"And you have been doing business with Russia for decades. You need to stop covering up. They are going to get you best to turn yourself in now.","379":"Let's just say there was no collusion. Do you care at all that Russia is doing this?  \n\nI guess not. I've never heard you say so.","380":"Mr. President, please stop this ridiculous investigation now. After the absurd announcement that 13 Russians were indicted all I could do is laugh. What a travesty , yet Rosenstein stated that it was not over. Hasn't the tax payers money been wasted enough by this democrat witch hunt. Why does Rosenstein or Mueller still have jobs??  When will our Attorney General start the real investigation of the Obama , Hillary and DNC corruption and collusion with Russia to destroy you?? The people are fed up with the onslaught day after day from the msm and democrats when they are the criminals and it is plain to see. This will not end well for the country if we cannot bring the democrats to justice.","381":"Mr. President, you could cure cancer and some people would find something wrong with it. Agree or disagree with you, watching how some acted at the State of the Union, disgusted me. They wouldn\u2019t even clap for things they wanted that you accomplished. It reminds me of how my teen acts when she is mad at me. Childish. As an American, I have respect for our President.","382":"Russia didn't make me vote for Trump we need to let the Democrats know that it was Obama and the thought of having Hillary for president","383":"I pray for President Trump, to see thai. Putin, from Russia and he, know that I will agree for the Will of the Lord, in both nations. Please know that Putin agreed to wait on learning more truth on this earth.","384":"We knew it all along! Donald J. Trump...All this time, all the money spent on these investigations and that's all they came up with? Russian scapegoats to distract the attention off themselves? Rosenstein was very strange as he shared this today! FBI was too busy working in cahoots with the corrupt DNC, Obama, Clintons, trying to cover up to even bother investigating Nikolas Cruz to save children's lives!","385":"And maybe if the the FBI put more of their resources towards investigating the leads given to them about potential school shooting threats instead of a wild goose Chase trying to bring you down, we wouldn't have the Florida tragedy to explain to our kids today.  Pathetic excuse for a government agency... this kid was a giant red flag.... but no, let's Chase Russian collusion.....  stupidity!","386":"I knew you would be exonerated, President Trump.

Hillarys track record was enough for me to make my decision. \nCarry on POTUS!!!","390":"Didn\u2019t Orange man say he took Putin at his word and that Russia didn\u2019t interfere in the election.  He\u2019s obviously not very bright.","391":"Didn't influence me either. I would never vote for Hillary.  Long before she ran for this. Heard about Clintons dirt when he was governor.","392":"Listening to Rosenstein's press conference today, the whoe thing sounded more like another Russian money-making scam that used the political arena to scam people out of their money than it did any sort of election interference operation.","393":"When media keeps on and on about something..... Never even worried about it! Knew it wasn\u2019t true. Ever. They have NEVER gotten their facts right. Always rushing to judgement & misquotes. On any story. They have lost all credibility.","394":"We knew the Russians were trying to influence our election. This is not news. The investigation was to determine if there was collusion with the Trump campaign. There was not. But if it's a crime to actively talk about how bad a person Hillary is and what a dangerous President she would have been because of her sociopathic need for power, then start rounding up tens of millions of patriots, including me.","395":"It's a miracle!!!! Russia is \"fighting\" against the USA, but namely the US has plenty of military bases all over the world!)","396":"It is likely that most recognize that the past year or more much time and money was spent \"chasing invisible villains.\"  Continue to focus on law and order; homeland security; and ensuring that government employees are diligently and honorably doing their jobs.","397":"Do not makw war all over the world....What's wrong with Russia?

(fire Meuller, Rosenstein, Sessions and start criminal investigations of the prior administration)","493":"I thought you said there was no Russian interference?  Now you\u2019re saying there was.  \n\nHey, remember that time your son arranged a meeting at Trump Tower with a group of Russians who said they had dirt on Hillary?  Remember how he talked about in with Hannity?  \n\nGood times.","494":"Whether you colluded is irrelevant.  (Even though you did encourage the Russians to hack during a debate with Hillary on a live TV). Now that the evidence of Russian interference is true, your moves to obstruct the investigation are more evident than ever.","495":"I want a second special council. 13 Russian nationals come in the country through John Kerry's state Dept with intent on meddling in our election system. No mention of how they got in anywhere. I suspect strong political bias in Mueller's investigation. It's a joke at this point. None of those Russians will ever see a day in court. They will fight extradition by saying they won't get a fair trial here and win. We are no closer to knowing the truth today than we were yesterday","496":"HEY Trump... Say that 3 times and click your heels.  The many investigations against you and your Administration say different.  Just because your RED Repubs believe you, doesn't mean it's not happening.","497":"See, this is one of the reasons why we need to be careful who we let in our Country...So build that wall and back ground check everyone who comes to the USA..Also put out anyone who hasn't enter America the right way..We need to know who is here and if they are good or evil..","498":"Wait, are you telling me the Russians are a geo political threat despite what Obama and liberals said in the 2012 election","499":"I first realized I was voting for Trump very early and it actually happened after U.S. Media, mainly CNN who had colluded with the Clinton campaign to sway the Democrat nomination process as well as the general election,  reported Trump had said various antisemitic remarks during a speech  at a Jewish businessmen meeting. I was mad at Trump so I went and watched the speech in its entirety and loved it! The crowd loved it. He was cool and charming talking straight. I realized the press was so disgustingly biased not only could they never be believed concerning elections again but I was voting for that guy. Russians? Try CNN.","500":"Great! Now that the President and his administration is clear, again, let's go after Obama Hillary and her cronies for their interference in the same election. And Senators, stop harping on this made up issue of White House interference. There's no evidence to date that's supports your false narrative. You're sowing dissent for personal and Democratic political gain.","501":"The Trump campaign did nothing wrong. However, the Clinton campaign, DNC, Justice Department, FBI, CIA, Hillary Clinton, Barack Hussein Obama, Adam Schiff, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and others have all committed Treason and sedition. When will they pay for their crimes?","502":"What the FBI said was that they worked BOTH sides....put us at odds with each other so that in  the end we won't accept what ever came out of it and makes for a perpetual disagreement of the outcome of the election...SO smart so called educated liberals....why can't you SEE that","503":"Mr President, there are 130 WH officials who haven\u2019t passed background checks, and don\u2019t have security clearances. Dozens are top level positions who report directly to you and handle classified information. Please have your chief of staff release a full list of the 130 people the FBI hasn\u2019t cleared, but you personally have. They are a risk to our national security. Thank you.","504":"Long before...,wow!\nBut no action even long after!!!\nEven while you say \u201cRussia started their anti-US campaign \u201c?","505":"A lot of Russian medling with NO ONE taking action.  There was a lot of collusion prior to President Trump, does Uranium One ring a bell.  Why would you sell your enemy 20% of our uranium?","506":"Unless a Russian walked you to the voting booth and held a gun to your head to vote for Trump... it didn't change the outcome of the election.  I wouldn't be surprised if Soros didn't pay these people off.\ud83d\ude33 the media uses social media to influence people ... they should be indicted too. God bless","507":"I guess the \"investigation\" was getting too close to incriminating Obama, Hillary and the FBI.  Suddenly they cough up 13 Russians that colluded with Americans, BUT the Americans didn't know they were dealing with Russians.  The blame on these 13 Russians sure showed up in a nick of time.","508":"We knew it all along anyway because Hillary Clinton and Obama are the ones who were the major influences for me not to vote for her!  \"Ads\" do not influence me \"action\" does!  The public should have seen enough of her actions to have a belly full of her way back when her husband was president.  How any female could support her is beyond my imagination.","509":"The Democratic Destroy everything they touch. \nThey can't be happy \ud83d\ude04 until they  ruin America 's chance to be Great Again.  \nJust ask yourself\u2026 they have been the champion of the poor.  Haven't seen folks coming off welfare yet.","510":"Liberation from any religious and political domination , because these two branches, and the other dominions created on the earth, are serpent venom (for modeling and limiting people) , people seem to be free (but they live like a prison in their own body)  :)","511":"Anyone with common sense knows this. Your track record is better than any politicians, ever.  It is why you have already won the 2020 election, and only gaining support. Although you called the Dems bluff on DACA, something must be done, and in reality, how many tens of millions of illegals are here?","512":"You told many Russians about your plans long before.   \n\n@SethAbramson\n\"Mr. Trump, you told the Russians you'd be running for president in Moscow in November 2013\u2014and indeed it was that declaration that led to the anti-U.S. campaign in early 2014. Cohen had made clear by mid-2013 you were running; you confirmed it to the Agalarovs and Yulya Alferova.\"","513":"Until Democrats own up to orchestrating Russian interference to win an election, the party will continue on its collision course with those of us still standing when old glory is hoisted. When will justice serve notice on Obama minions that STILL have actors in government undermining the President?","514":"Why Mr. Donnie Dimwit, do you alway go on the defensive? Sounds like guilt to me! Lock him up!!! \ud83d\udd12 Donnie is a criminal, and has been one most of his adult life!","515":"God is on your side President Trump. God himself will protect you and your legacy. Let them laugh. God is going to demonstrate His goodness concerning you.","516":"It's disheartening to see the president constantly trying to defend himself. While the left keep throwing crap against the wall hoping it will stick. The intentions are clear. Distractions. Maybe if if they keep on..he will fail. Our country will go down the toilet. \"We'll show the republicans! No matter what!\" (Braniacs that the left are).Keep your eye on the ball Mr. President, you're doing a great job.","517":"My vote for Trump was a vote against Hillary but it was only a short time until I realized it was a great decision to vote for Trump. And I will vote for him again, and then for our VP when Trumps 8 years are up.  They are doing a great job. Can't wait to see who Pence will choose for his VP.","518":"Good grief. They were Facebook trolls. Anyone who uses Facebook knows who they are and are not influenced by them. And there are a zillion more of them from right here in the good ol' USA. But grandma sees this on the news and we're being invaded! Yeesh!!! Let's move on and get back to work already. I am enjoying watching the left run out of ammo though LOL. \ud83d\ude80","519":"Yeah ok Donald J. Trump your Daughter in Law did an interview & it was discussed that you were planning to run in 2012 so you can post & tweet all you want to try & convince everyone that you had no involvement with the collusion, but everyone in your campaign & in your cabinet is going to turn on you & we are waiting for it to happen!\n #youareanembarassment #youwillnotgetawaywithanyofthis","520":"Did Donald Trump just acknowledge that Russia interfered in 2016 election? Yes I think he did. I think Donald Trump just acknowledged for the first time that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.","521":"I voted against Carter twice, Mondale, Dukakis, Clinton twice, Kerry, and Obama twice, because they represented Russia.  But I voted FOR Trump for the same reason?  LOL!!!","522":"The President won the election due to his own efforts alone. Rallies, debates, using his own money and not big donors\u2019 money.   And because Hillary was so bad a candidate, who freely welcomed illegal and fraudulent votes. It had nothing to do with any Russians.  Trump will be vindicated because there WAS NO COLLUSION.  It\u2019s time to wrap up this witch-hunt \u201cinvestigation \u201c.","523":"We believed all along. We already knew who was corrupt but the DOJ  is part of the problem. How do we fight when the corruption is so embedded? I do see a little ray of light cracking through nut we are still waiting for thiose corrupting people to be indicted.","524":"Have a good weekend Mr. Trump. I would love to meet you in Florida sometime. My golf game is rusty. I would need some practice at one of the clubs. I could play a round with my son and daughter but The Left-Wing Farce there threatens them not too see me and their adults!","525":"I knew he was innocent the entire time. Now what is the main steam media going to concoct to cause havoc? I bet they IF they cover this story it will be a quick flash on the screen and done. I think there should be a one cent increase tax on the dollar and it should be used solely on school safety and infrastructure. This way everyone pays. Placing a gas tax would only raise the cost of goods.","526":"I would like to thank all of the hateful people in this country. You make it easy for me to make a very tuff decision. When this country breaks out in a civil war. I'll have no problem with what is morally right. Y'alls hate is more than enough to prove there is no reconciliation  between the two sides. \"I will not fire the first shot.... but I will answer the call\". We are getting real close to the reset button.","527":"It's all total BS..., another reason why they brought out Rod Rosenstein to make it look like he's really doing something and not colluding himself with Mueller!!","528":"How many illegals voted in California I would say Mexico had a bigger influence on the election than Russia.","529":"Horse S***t. There is no doubt that the interference had an impact on a close election and it goes on every day RIGHT HERE ON THIS SITE!!\n\nThe only question is whether you knew that your supporters were doing it. Given that right this minute you are denying obvious fact, your word is worthless.","530":"Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and described a vast, sophisticated Russian operation that interfered in the electionand delivered to YOU the kind of evidence that would have any other intelligent and reasonable person understanding that any characterization of this as a hoax, an attack or a witch hunt is inappropriate ... aka a lie.","531":"Yeah. It's all about you.  You used the Russians to boost your campaign because winning was more important than the protection of our democracies.  You thought it was cool for Putin to hack the DNC because winning was more important that the protection of our democracies.  You announced that Podesta would spend time in the barrlel, so you knew.  You repeated erroneous reporting from Russian newspapers\/news organizations because you thought their help was more important than the protection of our democracies.  You are a crook.","532":"2014 was before you ANNOUNCED for president, but the Russians have been cultivating you since the 1990s, at least. Also, this indictment didn't even touch on the Russian hacking of the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Putin's got you in his hip pocket. And pretty soon Mueller will too.","533":"Most of us knew that and put our faith in you so let the fake agendas keep coming so they can ignore their jobs to save lives and dig into yours. If FBI had done their job the shooter in FL would be detained in a place to help his mental problems and 17 people would be alive","534":"I wish you the best this weekend sometimes its just listening hugging grieving with as I am sure most are still morning emotional angry...

It is the illegal alien vote to the dems!\n\nThe good part is even with the 4 million or so fraudulent votes we have a potus we can be proud of. \n\nKeep on draining that swamp President Trump!","537":"I knew it!!!!!!!!! One thing I must say on another matter, please do not get rid of the snap program, my husband is older, and he and I have diabetes. We depend on the snap program, due to my divorce and an ex that made sure I couldn't get any kind of Social Security Benefits. My husband and I, both, are disabled, and there are many others like us that need the snap benefit to be able to eat a proper diet!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you, Mr. President, I have faith you will do the right thing, on it and any other issues!!!!!!!","538":"I voted for Donald J. Trump because the Democrats and RINOs haven't had America best interest in mind for years. I changed from Dem to Republican because I was sick and tired of the lies and corruption in our government officials.","539":"They indicted Russian citizens and firms, with no extradition agreement between us and Russia. Very productive.","540":"I state now and for the record, Russia had absolutely nothing in my decision to vote for Donald Trump for president!","541":"Trump! Our Democracy is under attack! What are you going to do about it? Play golf? It's time for you to decide,Trump. Are you Putin's poodle, or are you the President of the United States? What are you doing on the golf course? Get to work! Protect our Country!","542":"Do people really believe that 13 'Russians' had more influence than the 140 million US citizens that voted?

I read that the whole Ruskie operation involved a million bucks, not enough to make any impact and a decent part of it was spent with regard to other races and candidates. They were only trying to disrupt things not benefit you !","549":"In sept 22,2013 l think it was Obama brought the Russian military into our Waters and into the Long Beach CA !!!

With regards to the indictments  - what a joke - they did not force or interfere with the voting system - they just imformed the American of the true facts about the Democraps- so why is telling the truth a criminal offence ?","553":"While expressing my opinion that Mueller should be shut down, I am now rethinking it. We know there is no Trump collusion.  Without Mueller we wouldn't know about the extent of Russian involvement.  Maybe Mueller really is doing a proper investigation.","554":"<3 <3 My President <3 <3 Who else woud have\/could have handled this insane attack so wonderfully ?  Thank you for loving our country !!","555":"That is BS. You have been working with the Russians for years. After all they are the ones that kept you from your next (and probably fatal) bankruptcy.

Must be because you are guilty and knew all along.","561":"I voted for Trump. I\u2019m not ashamed of it at all. I\u2019m sure this posting will disqualify me from getting a job at google, CNN, or ABC but I think the Donald is doing far better than many expected and it\u2019s causing a complete liberal meltdown.

Poooooor Little Sheppie.","569":"I wonder who did the most damage. Was it the Russians who created the fake stories and posted it on social media? Was it American citizens who believe everythi,g they see on the internet, and shared it? Was it the mainstream media who reported the fake stories as news without any effort to verify? Plenty of blame to go around. Time for journalists to restore standards. Time for people to disconnect from social media or be more skeptical. Time for all of us to realize there are always some who try to interfere with democracy. Time to remember the US has a history of interfering in other countries.","570":"I knew there was no collusion.  It\u2019s just that some poor souls are so afraid of your success.

Dems are so easily brainwashed","597":"THIS IS NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.\n\nIt's about a foreign power interfering and attempting to throw our elections.  \n\nHave nothing to say about that?  No taking back your \"it's all a hoax\"?  No reassurance to the nation that steps are being taken to make sure this doesn't keep happening?  Instead we hear a spokesperson say we can't do anything about it.\n\nMaybe that's because there is plenty of evidence that the interference aided you?","598":"Obama knew about Russian meddling long before the election and had hillary won NOTHING would of been said. Why was it ok for obama to meddle in Israel's election?","599":"It light of the tragic shooting in Florida where 17 people lost their lives which is very sad and heart breaking, where are the people who are pounding their chests for gun control when our society has allowed the murder of over 44 million babies due to abortion since 1970???\n44 MILLION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","600":"The Russians meddled to help any candidate that would help them the most. You just happened to be the best proto-fascist option for them. Doesn't mean they had no impact on the election results, whether you were actively colluding with them or not. Just because they started meddling in 2014, that doesn't mean they didn't choose to help you in 2016. Moron.","601":"So that means if i was robbing banks since 2014 \nIt would be impossible for me to rob a brand new bank that was just built in 2016...\nLet that sink in for a minute...\nThen I would declare there were no robbery...lol","602":"We know Mr. President but liberal news channels won't stop they have convicted you before you won the presidency, they don't believe your guilty either only high dollar law suits are going to stop them. We both know who owns these media channels.","603":"I believe that because of the Russian collusion with Donald Trump campaign and Russians working to elect Donald Trump,yes!Russian help trump got elected.","604":"I am not sold on the indictments of the 13 Russians yet.  It sounds like something they came up with because they were about to be exposed of all their corruption!  I'm talking about Mueller and his cronies.  They had to come up with something, right!","605":"Democrats, quit whining and go to work.....make America great again,  earn your keep...do something useful,  shuck Chuck and Nancy and half of your cons tutu ants ( spellcheck ). Lol !  Pj out the door...get some people that still have some brain matter left and get to work!","606":"The fact is that the Russians (former Soviet Union) have been attempting to meddle in our elections since the end of WWII with the help of the democrats.","607":"Wait a minute, I thought the whole Mueller investigation was a nothing burger? So, basically what you're now saying is that you weren't corrupt, you were just outwitted by a group of midlevel Russian computer hackers that infiltrated your campaign.  Not sure which one I prefer to hear","608":"Never has been. Can we move on now MSM media? Nah, now we have to bring gun control back up and make up a bunch of ridiculous attachments that aren\u2019t available to non-military personnel. The stupidity will never end. Keep stoking the fire till 2020 morons!","609":"Bought and paid for by the NRA. Political contributions by corporations should never have been allowed. Now you see why.\n\nTo those politicians who keep saying \"Not now\", when then? You said the same thing after the Las Vegas shootings. Quit stalling. There will never be a \"right time\" in your eyes.\n\nWith these mass shootings happening which such frequency, there will never be a \"right time\" for Washington.","610":"Notice when you accused Obama of all sorts of stuff, he never dignified it?  That was a much better move, it made it seem like he didn't care or have anything to hide.  Why do you care so much?","611":"Actually Russia has been anti-U.S. forever.The question is not when Russia started their anti-U.S. campaign the question is when did Russia start their campaign to help Donald Trump get elected?","612":"I didn't vote for you because of propaganda. I voted for you because you were the only choice. All other choices were not an option. Don't want an establishment figure controlled by the elites. Want an independent figure that will do the right thing.","613":"Anger and aggression sometimes may feel as though they are protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation, but what needs to be acknowledged is that this type of energy is blind. It actually takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view. So for those of you who are spewing anger and aggression, try listening and calming down, you may well learn something new, you may still be right, you may be wrong, but you will have learned the truth without clouding the issue with anger.","614":"You keep on believing that Lord Little Hands. The reason the investigation is still going on is because they have a mountain of evidence. If they had none it would have been over long ago.","615":"If you put half as much effort into the gun issues as you do into the Russian election probing, this country would be great again. \n\nThat\u2019s alright. I\u2019m sure the families are happy with your thoughts and prayers though.","616":"The swamp is ridiculous, their corruption is unlimited. This witch hunt mist come to an end, and the real abuses, reported on the FISA Memo must be punished.\n\nReality has been inverted by the Marxist left.","617":"For appearance sake, I'd strongly suggest, Trump, you cancel those 60 Russians you have coming to the Washington Prayer Breakfast. Proceed at your own risk of further damage to your \"credibility\" (HA).\n\nBeing a moron, I'm sure you won't. It will however further damage you in the mid-term elections. Carry on you douche bag.","618":"here\u2019s the way it goes, and has been, for many decades..... the US tries to alter election outcomes of many countries, and many countries try to effect the US elections.  That\u2019s the way of the world..... spy vs spy kinda thing.... now, when a US citizen works with the country trying to effect election outcome, *that* is where a problem arises.","619":"and yet i read a liberals' comment on a different post who still thinks mueller is circling the wagons and with gates' deal, they are near ready to take trump out...LMAO..how do ya even respond to that kind of mindset..?","620":"They were doing the same thing that George Soros does,  so I hope to see him get indicted next. Since he spent and lost a billion dollars, on paid protesters and paid trolls among other things, trying to get Hillary Clinton elected, he controls the mainstream media with the exception of fox","621":"What a joke! So 13 Russians, some guy with a Happy Birthday sign outside the White House, and some trolls on Facebook didn't make us vote for Trump? How much time and $ has this wasted? FBI was so busy with this BS that they didn't have time to investigate at least two tips about the school shooter in Parkland. Unbelievable!","622":"Does not matter what the Russians did or did not do...2014 O bla bla was in office. Think about that. Also no one has to make Killary look bad. She does that all on her own. We KNOW this and knew this for a long time. No Russians then. She, Willy, and many others are crooks and have lived off us far too long.","623":"I don\u2019t care who was running against crooked Hillary, she was not getting my vote.  And I didn\u2019t need any help to make that call.","624":"They need to have something to focus on and someone to pick on.  I ignore them.  There are bigger things we need to battle than main stream medias rants and complaints!!","625":"I don't believe there was collusion.  I don't think the Trump's election campaign did anything wrong.  I don't think Russia's attempts impacted the results either.  What I don't understand, we admit something happened here \"Anti US campaign\"??? so why isn't the focus on making sure it doesn't happen again.  I haven't heard anything about what we are going to do to prevent it from happening again.  Nothing, just finger pointing on both side and crickets....","626":"OH NOWWWWWW you believe the \"RUSSIER\" thing is real? No 400 lb guy in his moms basement??? And to the point? Conspiracy is punishable by prison time and collusion isn't an offense.","627":"Mueller's indictment shows that Russia used race, religion, and guns to help Trump\u2014and harm the United States.","628":"I think a lot of us Americans realized that we just joined the club of being spied on by our own government for posting our political opinions on facebook\/twitter supposedly by russian collusion. What a joke.","629":"mass media lies to people ... and here Russia and America. two completely different in the development of the country ..\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd14","630":"I voted for Trump because my intuition told me Hilary and Obama were corrupt. I am however upset about more spending.  Leaving my kids and grandchildren in massive debt. Build the wall, stop spending money on illegals, pay off debt.","631":"I'm so glad you will now reveal your tax returns and business information.  The allegations that the Russian mob loaned you money when no US bank would are lacking merit and should be put to rest.  Show us how forthright your business and tax payments have been.","632":"It only took 13 Russians using facebook and twitter accounts to cause chaos in America? Don't forget the players in the FBI and DOJ, Soros backed Antifa, and a complicit mainstream media that did far worse to cause chaos and division.","633":"We all know that out here in the wilderness,and we also know about the corrupt media,and most of all we all know how the dems really feel about our country America.  Don't fret let not your heart be troubled. We all that still believe this country is by far the fairest country in the world have your back, see ya all at the voting both.","634":"Only tRump would make the interference of a hostile foreign power into our elections about him .... especially after calling the Mueller Probe as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.  Thank you, Robert Mueller and team for working to protect us and our elections.  We\u2019re counting on you because tRump and his administration aren\u2019t up to the job.","635":"Doesn\u2019t the US influence the politics and elections of other countries on a bigger scale yet? Information wars are always there, anyway. Listen to the authentic sources (not third parties), check the facts (words vs. actions), know your values, and make your own decisions. By the way, is there anyone more manipulative, ruthlessly manipulative, than the Democratic Party?","636":"This is NOT ABOUT YOU! This is about the country, not you! Whether it was you or another candidate, separate issue. Not everything is about you, go play golf. We will let you know what happens.","637":"It is begun in 2006 but doctrine made 2012 and the second time by my request didnt change by right documents so foliwing procedure combines with infrastructure it is became for today international saim round but im doing only in Belgium if I get an lawyer there to make this documents with\"hansen\"cases","638":"Donald this is not about u. This is about using somebody anybody like you. You happen to put urself in place at the wrong time n the right time for them n Russia. So clam it. Ur their itsky. Its hell isn't it? ??.","639":"It's not right that they get to \"investigate\" this for a longer period of time than trump spent running for president in the first place. I say it's past time to show their hand if they  got one, this will last 8 years if someone doesn't step in and stop it","640":"We knew you did nothing wrong from the beginning! I am thinking did the Russian start BLM and pay for it? No and we know that also! And are the Russian government paying the Democratic party money to resist? No and we know that! This FBI today Is so phony! I still don't trust anything they say! And if and I say if those rallies were not you or your family, we was fooled. But again I know you was the one that is doing the best job as president! Thank you and Vice president Pence! God bless you!","641":"Mr president I wouldn't waste my breath on trying to prove anything to those democrats, your first year in office speaks loudly for you.\nAm Arab America will vote for you next time that's for sure.","642":"Yeah yeah we already knew all that.

How sad , deluded , & frightened you ALL must live !!\ud83d\ude31","644":"LMAO. All the testimonials from Trump voters on how he was the better candidate and is doing a great job. Got their MAGA hats on. So proud if their decision to elect Don the Con. I can't wait for the midterm elections.","645":"You haven't been exonerated - only \"This indictment\" was referenced. What you can and should do right now is admit you were wrong - This is real and not a hoax. If nothing else, this is now blatantly in your face.","646":"Since the whole Russian effort was supposedly centered around their smearing Clinton (no matter how factual the smear) in order to \"meddle\" in the election, would it be possible to indict the 98% of corporate broadcast & print media who through the entire campaign and still to this day have been smearing President Trump in a seemingly coordinated fashion?","647":"These guys bought intended to help hillary. They believed what everyone was saying;Trump was unelectable. Therefore, by promoting Trump they intended to ensure Hillary's election. Miller's next indictment of foreign nationals interfering in our elections should be soros.","648":"What do you do when you have spent millions of taxpayer dollars , and still have nothing , indict russians , even though hussien tried to influence Israels election but that was democrat crime .","649":"Ever wonder that these democowards shoot up gun free zones like schools, churches, retirement homes and places that only the thugs have the gun. And to think there are dumbfounded people out there that want to take guns from law abiding citizens. Real smart.","650":"This isn't about your collusion with Russia.  What Russia has done is an act of war even if you weren't involved.","651":"If your first reaction to seeing unequivocal proof that an adversary nation has been, and continues to be, attacking our democracy is to declare your own vindication.....you\u2019re doing it wrong.","652":"Occasionally I like to pop in on this FB page. I find it amusing to read how these people can somehow still defend this moron. They have their heads buried so far in the sand that no matter what idiocy he spouts they continue to believe and support him. That quote that is attributed to him in People magazine about the Republicans being the dumbest group of voters might not actually be true, but I'm sure he believes it.","653":"Nothing to see here, no corruption, no lying, no colluding, no cheating, from the IRS, FBI, DOJ, 17 Intelligence agencies, Uranium 1, missing billions, money transfer to a state sponsored terrorist country, pay for play Clinton Foundation, arms transfer to Syria and the Benghazi debacle, and every unconstitutional action the Obama administration committed during his Presidency....","654":"I voted for Trump because the alternatives were horrible to contemplate. I don't care if the Russians were involved or not, to be honest. If they had anything to do with Trumps win, then I owe them one.","655":"This is a smoke screen for the real collusion that the democrats have for letting illegal immigrants vote in liberal and sanctuary states.  We do need election reform not letting illegal immigrants and others that are disqualified to vote.","656":"I am hard core liberal.  Bernie guy.  I believe likely.  No collusion. So why so defensive? Let\u2019s stop Russian meddling and let move forward.   But not more crap from trump about it.  He doth protest to much","657":"I also voted for Trump with no help from the Russians.  I prayed to God every night, not to stick us with Clinton, Obama for 8 years was more than I could take, but, I never acted like the lefty morons that have been crying for the last year.","658":"This might just be me thinking.... Does Mueller really want a billion dollar Russian Oligarch pissed at him? ....This can't be good. Well, he made his Russian bed so now he will have to sleep in it.. I would not want to be Mueller at this point..","659":"Hillary Clinton and\nher supporters must\naccept their loss in\nthe elections. Their\naccusation of Trump in complicity  with Russia Will not help them,  trump is now president of the United state.","660":"Let's get to the Hillary Clinton pay-to-play investigation when this phony democrat special counsel is over. This whole investigation was manufactured by the DNC to buy time and smoke screen the real stinky business of paying the FOUNDATION for political AND private favors.","661":"Unwitting.\nDefinition.\n\nnot knowing; unaware; \nignorant; oblivious; \nunconscious: \n\nExactly who I want in the White House.\nCollusion would have been an attempt at smart.","662":"Dear Mr. President.  I have the utmost respect for you and I pray for you always.  I support you and am so saddened by the state of angst in our Country now.  It's not you.  I believe it was under the surface before you were elected because of WHERE Obama was leading us.  That being said.  I am praying for the day when this statement made above about collusion SCREAMS from every headline.  Have a blessed day.","663":"No outside influences made me vote otherwise... it was time for a Republican to be our President...look at all the millions of dollars wasted to prove your innocence...this should have all been done behind the scenes starting in 2014.. President Obama in my opinion just swept everything under the rug, smiled and acted like everything was perfect in America...sad but true","664":"Collusion is only a crime if it is done by a republican not democrat. It is the IC that colluded with the Russians, foreign intel services like the GSCQ, and in Ukraine to stop you from being elected. Maybe the Russians helped you to beat the 17 Governors\/Senators in the Republican primaries ?","665":"So what about those sanctions? Now for the first time you actually said what the FBI and DOJ told you a long time ago that  our elections were compromised!  Are you going to enforce those sanctions now?  ..most likely not because Trump you are a Putin loving wannabe Dictator!","666":"Yeah I will believe you when you tell the truth consistently, work for the people, disclose your taxes, and actually submit proof someone else other than your NON ELECTED FAMILY to run your myriad of businesses.","667":"We all know that no collusion occurred! They are just throwing away tax payer money. We voted Trump and will again. No Russian influence at all. We believed in what he stands for. Simple as that, the better candidate.","668":"Clarification - no collusion on the part of the Trump campaign or the Republicans.  The other shoe may still drop in a sweet irony, catching the schemers in their own web of lies.  Perhaps we may ultimately see fulfillment of the campaign chant...\"Lock her up!\"","669":"We know and stopped listening to the left whine, a long time ago.  Besides it is naive to think that every country does not seek to influence the outcome of elections of its rivals and enemies.  We certainly do it as well.","670":"People think we are so stupid to think anything written through the media would have an impact on something so important as a vote. I only listen to what comes out of the person themselves not an interpretation","671":"Just because you hadn't announced it, doesn't mean you hadn't informed them. Mueller is coming for you. Can't wait.","672":"Meeting with the Russians to get e-mails stolen from Clinton's campaign isn't exactly squeaky clean. Campaign aides bragging about Russia's stolen e-mails to foreign dignitaries isn't squeaky clean. Multiple members of your cabinet lying to FBI about meeting with Russian dignitaries isn't clean. And firing the head of the FBI so he will stop investigating the lying is dirty as hell. All this is \"nothing wrong\" to you. But you have had three wives and the mistresses keep adding up - so I'm pretty sure we don't share the same morals.","673":"ring up yer friends  in Detroit here , we need this bill passed so we can get these dispensaries up and running  legally  $$$ jobs and  relief for those whom need.","674":"Burisma Holdings\tEdit\nOn April 18, 2014, Burisma Holdings announced Biden's appointment to its board of directors in a press release.[15] Burisma is the largest non-governmental gas producer in Ukraine; it was incorporated in 2006 and is based in Limassol, Cyprus - a European tax haven.[16][17] Burisma holds licenses covering","675":"Of course the entire election process was affected, and the effect is we have you, tRump, in the Oval.\n\nand that's how to use affect\/effect instead of the lame impact....dumbshit","676":"Wow. You really do only care about you.  You\u2019ve shown no concern that a foreign power had been trying for nearly four years to upend American democracy, much less resolve to stop it from continuing to do so this year.","677":"I blame the Obama admin.and Obama himself, for plotting and scheming against....the constitution, our laws (he ignored and would not enforce) and his agenda, to make the USA weak. And he is still out there, stirring up trouble. The only reason the Russians could do anything negative towards US, is because Obama gave them a Green Light, not a Reset button. Hope you remedy this by going after the enemies within our country! It takes two to tango! Shine the spotlight on the others who enabled the outside interference!","678":"President Trump we know this. No need to defend anymore. What a waste of money to go any further. I voted for you because you weren't a politician. I'm from Arkansas and most these folks don't even realize how far back the Clinton'$ corruption runs.","679":"I read the cliff notes \ud83d\udcdd from the inditement & they did nothing any worse than what the PACs do every election \ud83d\uddf3 cycle. They sent people to do research & get a feel for what the hot button issues are in our country, then they took to social media & promoted candidates based upon those hot button issues in purple states. If Bernie or Hillary had campaign managers with this same resourcefulness & vision, they probably would have done better in their elections. The Russian\u2019s didn\u2019t pay \ud83d\udcb0 for any TV \ud83d\udcfa ads (where I have seen US PACs do much worse mudslinging), yet only had a budget of under 2 million dollars \ud83d\udcb5 & did most of their work posting things on Facebook & Twitter for free. Taking a step back & looking \ud83d\udc40 at what they actually did, it was really a brilliant election strategy. Hillbilly Hillary spent millions of dollars \ud83d\udcb5 on her failed campaign & has nothing to show for it. These Russians were bootstrapping it & they seem to have made a significant impact on American\u2019s choices for their next President, at least according to Robert Muller.","680":"Nothing that has been revealed so far corroborates your statement. The investigation is ongoing. Even if true, the Russians attempted to hack our election and are still at it. WTF are you going to do to make sure they aren\u2019t successful in the future? Apparently nothing.","681":"The economy and stock market are the result of programs President Obama put into effect, and which Little Loser Donnie is destroying every chance he gets.  Tiny Trump is a Dope.","682":"Today's indictments aren't about Trump's, or his campaign's, possible role. That will come later. Pay attention, folks. In the meantime, looks like Manafort might be getting some new digs.","683":"Liar, liar, pants on fire!

Then arrest him.","686":"Hahahahahahaha. Donald is running out of convincing reasons to stop the investigation. Now he is switching gears from fake news and no collusion to the interference in our election started way earlier in 2014. Funny!","687":"Why do we continue to discuss or comment on anything on political posts? First of all, they are usually terrible conversations. And secondly how do you know you ain't talking to some Ruskie troll?","688":"Those of us that believe in you never doubted you.  Those that believed these  lies, despite no evidence, WANTED to believe. It's a new dawn when ya try to take down the government.","689":"To all America \nWhat.

This seems like a fine time to focus on the God-blessed election! You are a disgrace!","697":"I knew from the beginning this would be the outcome, keep up the great work you are doing for the USA.

You are so fixated on yourself that you have refused to address this problem head on And protect the American people from this act of war against us!","703":"The whole world tried to interfere in your election. I'm British and Obama had GCHQ wiretapping Trump tower. John  Oliver was character attacking Trump regularly on his Daily show. I really think what these Russians did was really very insignificant. Then you have to prove if they acted independently , or under orders of the Kremlin.","704":"i feel the democrats should pay us back for all the wasted time and distraction they created on this man hunt they have engaged in since the election.   (Anyone seen the documentary on the Clinton\u2019s.   Far too many deaths and fortune to be coincidental.)\nI was a democrat for years until I voted for you.  I was especially turned off by the  inability of Dems to accept and move on in support of you.

Let\u2019s get some work done.","705":"I think today\u2019s indictment announcement was an attempt to wash the blood of 17 people in Florida off their hands. \u201cLook! We do stuff!

Thanks to Trump ,, we are beginning to see a Great America again...","710":"How about we focus on the real criminals, maybe an objective, truth based look at the Clintons, and the many people who were going to testify against them an found themselves dead.

So your brother dies from alcohol addiction and then you invest in wineries and other alcoholic beverages ? Why you gotta be a part of the problem when you can be a part of the solution , bro ? The American Medical Association is for a ban on alcohol advertising and is do greatly raising the price of it .

Why isn't Mueller going after Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Clinton Foundation, Rosenstein, and McCabe?","832":"You\u2019re going down! I love it! Screaming lies to your base won\u2019t save you. Anyone with half a brain and time to research real facts will come to the same conclusions.

Yet they are so eager to find Russian opinion footprints to indite our president. Such a joke!","843":"Let's say that's true..that DOES NOT mean they didnt interfere and help you when you decided to run. I bet they busted a nut when they realised you could easily be bought and controlled","844":"Just so funny how Democrats twisted  yet again about Trump is being in trouble. I heard the AG speech!! Lol. It started 2014!! It's Obama's era you all!!!!","845":"Well after all, Obama said their was no meddling by Russians in approx. Oct. 2016.  His advise to our future President was to go out and campaign if you want to win.  Yippee we got a winner!!","846":"They are reporting only part of the report.

This is nuts that they can get away with it and you still defend this bs.","848":"lets put the blame where it should be the F B I DID NOT DO THIER JOB IT WAS REPORTED AND THEY DID NOTHING  they are responsible for the lives of 17 children and they should have to answer that to the parents of the children its about time people hold the ones hired to do a job to do their job or replace them","849":"What about the over 500 times America has tried to control the outcome of elections in other countries?

Stupid idiot did you really think you would get away with this?","851":"Mr. President, can you ask the DOJ\/FBI\/CIA to begin the investigation on \"Illegal immigration voting\" in this nation before the 2018 elections?  We have states that are allowing illegals to vote.  This is a big issue for the conservatives of this nation.","852":"Shephard Smith was pretty much salivating on himself with the latest Russian report,, and twisting the words to suit his own agenda!

It's not all about you !!!!","855":"Big picture, people.  A hostile foreign power commits crimes which we, as Americans, are okay with as long as they undermine the political candidate we oppose?  Not okay.  And 17 indictments are the tip of the iceberg.  Much more to come.  You know it.  Still waiting to see when House and Senate Republicans decide to be Americans first, their own party second.  Our democracy is more important than one person, one party.","856":"Mr. president, The people that are chasing these things live in a type of Dream World where everything is free and people can do anything they want as long aa it fits the liberal program.","857":"So let's now remove Mueller and his staff from the government slop trough !!!  He and his staff must be taking thousands every day from America's tax payers and lining their own pockets.

Let's see if you get it or they just go away licking their wounds!! Now, let's work on Hilliary and that whole memo thing!!","869":"If a campaign started in 2014 while president obama was in office then why wouldnt they continue that to get someone in office they wanted? Also, if you know this why didnt you keep them out of the US","870":"What are you doing to stop them from continuing their meddling? Admitting there is a problem and trying to solve it doesn't mean you're admitting they impacted the election.","871":"Obama took $200K of our money and spent it on ads in Israel trying to stop Bibi from being reelected.

I'm sure China and other countries do it as well. I'm sure we do the same around the world... Democrats and Republicans do it, Lobbyists do it for countless causes on both sides of the aisle... Corporations do it..\n\nMaybe I'm naive, but if I could influence an election that would help me, my family, my work, or my country, I would do it in a heartbeat...\n\nIs it only a big deal because they were not registered lobbyists? or because Hillary lost?","883":"Uhm yeah, only you've been involved with Russians and have been trying to get Putin's attention well before 2014 buddy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d. Oh well, not my circus, not my monkeys :).","884":"If I was Trump...in fact...if any normal human being was Trump...they would be WELCOMING the investigation to prove innocence...rather than doing his best to halt proceedings all the time.","885":"And we spent how many millions to find out what we already know.  Russia isn't the only ones I am sure","886":"trump friend, you are very welcome, I am from venezuela, waiting to intervene venezuela, my name is jesus gutierrez, Venezuelan, my country is not so hungry anymore, and misery please do what happened to noriega precidente de panama, take out that rat thief venezuela to the already godded hair","887":"Mr President dont even waste more time. There is no collusion, this is absurd, where is the investigation about Hillary and 33k emails deleted?. God has mercy!!! Tired of this nonsense","888":"Robert Mueller is coming for comrade trump.  Open your eyes, the noose is getting tighter.  Bannon met with Mueller\u2019s prosecutors for multiple DAYS this week, they weren\u2019t talking about golf.

We are all Americans, treat each other with respect.","889":"So, Russians are trying to cause discord in America.  While the FBI was working on this obvious conclusion, they missed glaring signals that a troubled young man was planning to cause mass carnage to Americans in one of our schools.  My heart is breaking for the victims, their families, their friends, their community, and for America.","890":"Members of Trump's inner circle, including Jared Kushner, exchanged emails and met with lawyers connected to the Kremlin to discuss dirt on Clinton. That is collusion.","891":"Their way of saying we better stop while we are ahead. Investigation was going to take down a bunch of democrats.","892":"Not important, it is over, get on with what is important. It never happened so why don't you dig into Schumer and Muellers past see what you find.? THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.....","893":"Now we can take on the real criminals Mr President Donald J. Trump. And keep making America great and safe again. Godspeed sir and God Bless.","894":"Russia had no anti US campaign, it's US who is doing anti  Russian campaign; remember no NATO expansion was promised.","895":"If that\u2019s true - go ahead and enact the sanctions against Russia. What are YOU so afraid of MR. Trump?","896":"The Democrats and MSM colluded against Trump. They leaked and the media printed lies from the fake dossier. They should be indicted for collusion and attempting  to interfere with an election.","897":"Mr. Trump, you are the first honest president we have had in a very, very long time. I guess that is why so many dishonest and misguided people don't like you. Keep up your good work!","898":"You keep saying that as if repeating it will change the course of the investigation where there\u2019s a lot of smoke. You\u2019re going down, loser.","899":"Funny how they're forcing this so bad still when it's so old and they're trying to take away focus from real issues... it's okay Mr. President fake news doesn't phase me none","900":"the only ones that influniced my volt were the democrats because the way they started  putting other countries first, trampleing on our contution, and supporting isis ,causeing more racial division than this country seen in 100 years,support the killing of cops,list goes on and on","901":"Mr President you should have done like obama and bill, cleaned house and got ppl that are loyalty to what ur trying to do, get rid of them..","902":"I knew it was all a pack of lies.

Thank You for saying  \"Yes\" to God's Call...   0X   :)","904":"You can't use the investigation is a hoax made up by the democrats because they lost as an excuse, it was started do to what George Papadopoulos sed to a top Australian diplomat.","905":"They have been doing this since at least ww2. Why is it even important? Obama used our money to try to take out Bibi, and control the Canadian election.  he took down Lybya and his evil deeds are all  over this world. But we never hear about that","906":"There is nothing wrong if u are a friend of russia. just that u.s should be an independent sovereign state.","907":"How about focusing on doing something about school shootings instead of worrying about your image.

It's just that the American electorate is not so bright.","910":"When can we expect you to initiate the sanctions against the Russians that was voted on, but not enacted, several months ago. Seems as though you suffer from Putin Envy or lack the gonads to say anything negative about him.","911":"But yet people from your administration have been indicted and have turned themselves in....I will wait to hear it from Mueller before I take anyone's word on it..","912":"This explains why the poll numbers favored Clinton and all the violence from paid participants at the rallies.

What happened to your executive order instructing the IRS not to penalize those who don't have health insurance?","1024":"Most of us know there was major collusion with Russia, not that Russia is an enemy although without question they do not like this country. That is probably because they hold our nation accountable for the acts that our nation was used to carry out. There are millions of people in this country that are fully aware of the exploitation we have endured for a very long time from people within our government that have not and\/or do not represent what we elected them for. Some of these people were major players in colluding with Russia and we expect these people to be held accountable for their actions, and it should start by LOCKING HER UP!

Now, getting me to believe that they wanted to HOBBLE your Presidency by creating the ILLUSION of collusion, is very easy. So what if they started in 2014? They are chess players, capable of thinking multiple moves ahead, and psychological gambits to dishearten, distract and demotivate opponents are part of competitive chess.","1041":"Oh I don't know about that! I had 13 Russians call and persuade me to vote for Donald Trump! (sarcasm off now)","1042":"Here is what you did wrong.  The GOP blames mental illness when they removed the Bush and Obama mental illness amendments to NICS just last year.  Trump and the GOP did this within 2 months after Trump was elected.

Conclusion , Backfire !!!","1052":"Good Trump now you can take Putin to task. You can apply those sanctions. You can add new ones. You can finally protect the U.S. the way a President is expected to do. Your national security has told you the Russians are still going ahead with their cyber war against the U.S..

He would have succeeded with an indictment.","1070":"You all need to wrap this crap up already. The FBI is so concerned with all this BS that they totally missed the chance to stop the A=Hole who shot 17 kids and adults in Florida.","1071":"And the Russians wanted another Socialist \/ Communist Bernie Sanders to win because they thought wrong that Americans would vote for Trump.

No. For several years, our chief Intelligence officers (heads of the FBI and DIA) have said that the greatest danger now comes in the form of cyberattack. And in 2016, they were vindicated, as we suffered a cyber thrust into the very heart of our democracy, the election of President.\n\nAs the 2018 election approaches, Do we prepare for the next onslaught? Hardly. Trump has given no directive that direct action be taken to prevent or blunt another Russian cyberattack, nor is there in place any credible deterrence. In fact, Trump\u2019s administration has chosen NOT to implement new sanctions that were ordered against a Russia as punishment for their 2016 interference. \n\nThe NYTimes writes, \u201cThere should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,\u201d said Mr. Coats, testifying alongside Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director; Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director; and other leading intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cThroughout the entire community, we have not seen any evidence of any significant change from last year,\u201d Mr. Coats said.\n\nThe warnings were striking in their contrast to President Trump\u2019s public comments. He has mocked the very notion of Russian meddling in the last election and lashed out at those who suggested otherwise.\n\nMr. Trump has not directed his intelligence officials to specifically combat Russian interference, they said. But Mr. Pompeo said that the president has made clear that the C.I.A. has \u201can obligation, from the foreign intelligence perspective, to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s a deep and thorough understanding of every threat, including threats from Russia.\u201d\n\nRussia appears eager to spread information \u2014 real and fake \u2014 that deepens political divisions. Bot armies promoted partisan causes on social media, including the recent push to release a Republican congressional memo critical of law enforcement officials.\n\nThe bots have also sought to portray the F.B.I. and Justice Department as infected by partisan bias, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee.\n\n\u201cOther threats to our institutions come from right here at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been some, aided and abetted by Russian internet bots and trolls, who have attacked the basic integrity of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.

He is estimated to being worth more than a billion rubles, but that isn't so very huge, in terms of comparison to the main Russian Oligarchs. He is quite a small fish to catch. One that may have been doing more than one type of business. The restaurant business, and particularly when it caters to the rich and powerful, is sometimes known as a potential listening post. A place where things can be overheard, and sometimes said, that would not be heard and said elsewhere. It is suspected that Prigozhin was in that type of business. You can sometimes make much more from scraps of information than you can make from selling hotdogs. So that might, or might not, tie him to organized crime, who also are known to engage in that type of traditional surveillance and tend to value, as well as find useful, that type of information acquisition...... \nWhat is evident is that there is no definite tie, of any sort, between him and the Russian government. That includes Putin, despite media sensationalism describing him as \"Putin's chef\". It seems a bit misleading and a bit desperate on the part of some of the American press. While the Russian mafia might well have utilized a small fish such as Prigozhin, that does not really take him far up the ladder. That in itself raises some interesting questions about who Prigozhin was working for, and why. Russian organized crime perhaps ? That would be an interesting finding. \nOddly enough there have been prior allegations of Clinton ties to the Russian mafia. Then again there have been allegations of Trump ties to the Russian mafia as well. Both are equally suspect, on every level. Such ties might exist, and it might yet be proven that there are such ties, judicially. Which side, Democrats, or Republicans, will fall into it, at that point, is an open question. It all depends on what evidence happens to surface. \nHere is what Wikipedia provides on him. \nIn 1990, after his release, he and his stepfather set up a network to sell hot dogs.[4] Soon, according to him, 'the rubles were piling up faster than his mother could count them.'[5] He also became the manager of and 15% stakeholder in \"Contrast,\" started by Boris Spektr, a classmate from his boarding school, which was the first grocery store chain in Saint Petersburg. In 1995, when revenues began to fall, Prigozhin convinced a director at \"Contrast,\" Kiril Ziminov, to open a restaurant with him. The two opened the \"Old Customs House\" (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0422\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044f), which was one of the first elite restaurants in Saint Petersburg. In 1997, inspired by waterfront restaurants on the Seine in Paris, Prigozhin and Ziminov spent $400,000 remodeling a rusting boat on the Vyatka River and started the floating restaurant \"New Island,\" which quickly became one of the most fashionable dining spots in Saint Petersburg.[4][5] According to him, his patrons \"wanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka.\" In 2001, Prigozhin personally served food to Vladimir Putin and French president Jacques Chirac when they dined at \"New Island\", and to US President George W. Bush in 2002. In 2003, Putin celebrated his birthday at \"New Island.\"[5] By 2003, Prigozhin had left his business partners and established his own independent restaurants. The Anti-Corruption Foundation accused Prigozhin of corrupt business practices; his illegal wealth estimated to be worth more than one billion rubles.[6]","1870":"\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  I knew Trump would spin this.

This follows the use of parables in the Bible. The Messiah relied on relating to people with everyday ordinary life experience that people could relate to. Here's an example:\n\nThe Story of a Man Named Ken\n\nOnce upon a time there was a man named Ken. People loved and respected Ken so much they began naming suff after him. As Americans explored and settled the wild west they began establishing new states. A particularly hilly region organized and requested Statehood to join America. Contemplating what to name this new United State, they decided it needed to be named after the man named Ken. So being hilly and all this provided many little hidden valley's known as tucky's. Thus the State of Ken's Tucky or Kentucky became a US State. Now Kentucky was well known throughout the world for a special art form of story telling and talking in a manner not heard anywhere else in the world. For example when they were sharing good news with each other people would exclaim \"Dawn. That is worth Killen for\". This word was also founded on naming things after Ken. They just put \"ill\" in the middle of Ken. Example\" One lucky fella got lucky and proudly proclaimed he had got a date with the most attractive women in town. She was a Playboy Model. Folks proclaimed \"Now that is worth killen for \" with great emphasis and joy for the fella. \n\nSo the word Ken become used as the starting point to create new names of things people wanted to talk about. Do a word search and see how many times folks made words using the man named Ken. \n\nNow to the point of the Story. President Donald Trump's highest and truly remarkable achievement? In ONLY his first year in office is (drum roll please): He has told MORE STORIES than ALL OTHER PRESIDENTS COMBINED. IN JUST ONE YEAR. A feat that will never be equaled.\n\nWhat do you think is the moral of this story about A Man Named Ken?A","3674":"When will some of the democraps be indicted ?","3675":"now get rid of the investigator!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","3676":"Youd best to keep a tight lip Donnie..they're coming for you","3677":"What are you going to do about it so it doesn't happen again.??","3678":"Fbi dropped the ball in florida fire wray need new leardership to the fbi drain the swamp.","3679":"Knew it already.

When I came back to it a month later, the price had steadily increased to $8 per coin. Surprised at my small windfall, and thinking it was too soon for Bitcoin to really take off, I sold all 100BTC for $800 and planned to buy in again when the price went down.\u201d However, he never did it. \u201cI watched it climb and climb until I finally bought back in around $100, netting me 8 BTC.\n\u201cI let my feelings get the best of me and panic sold\/bought a few times during the 2013 turmoil, and most recently had to sell a few BTC as I was in dire straights,\u201d the Redditor adds to his or her story.\n\u201cNow I have a little over 2BTC and am marginally better off than I was in 2012. I like to believe that if I had been financially comfortable in 2012 I would have bought a chunk of BTC to save long term and wouldn\u2019t have been so quick to sell. But who knows?

(Ha,ha,ha!). So funny! Dirt on Hillary and dispelling Russian sanctions were the REAL agenda. Give me ONE reason why 45 would privately meet with Putin and with a Russian interpreter only. Incredibly stupid. One reason besides not having a witness to the content on our side. Give me one reason 45 refused to implement sanctions on Russia that 98% of congress demanded. WHY? Congress can't agree on 98% of ANYTHING. 45 said, \"Nyet!\" There wasn't anyone vindicated in this indictment. \"Keep your paranoia in tact 45.

If proven to be true, this will criminalize Obama, Clinton and Obama\u2019s puppet Ashraf Ghani.

This witch hunt always comes back to HRC and dems so, they have to create more drama.

Why can\u2019t you let him do his work?","6617":"Both sides trying to prove something, Democrats started this , so much on killary its dumbfounding, FBI heads and others a somewhat joke now, so to save face on both sides here is my prediction = it ALL eventually gets mostly blamed on russians only with the exception of a few americans, trump and killary get vindicated and no one goes to prison, hence saving face.","6618":"Less than 20% of Americans voted for Trump, he couldn\u2019t even pull the popular vote and if Bannon hadn\u2019t run him ragged in the rust belt he would have lost that too.

Let's exercise our power America!!!","6620":"I've come to a conclusion Americans when they commit a crime are held responsible and prosecuted but when illegals come into the country break the law by coming in illegally they are not prosecuted and held accountable so what the dems and liberals are saying is that some laws can be broken and it's ok if it benefits them but some laws cannot be broken they are a contradiction breaking the law is breaking the law and these people should be held accountable as well as the people that are allowing them to break the law it. People should be held accountable all the way across the board.

Russians and every other country have been trying to screw with our country for as long as we've been a nation. Nothing new. Obama sent Biden to screw around with the Israeli elections. This is what countries do to each other. This further vindicates Trump and further exposes this fake investigation for the attempt to overthrow our governmental system. But these facts will not be told to the people who rely on CNN and MSNBC, ABC, NYT, Huff Post and all the rest of the liberal socialists for their information. They are 100% biased for liberal Democrats and against everything conservative.

There are laws in place, some need to be erased. No one should think they are above the law, including government. Our government or fake news media (which are being paid by someone or brain washed like the rest) should not be allowed to continue on as they have for over a year.

Which means that many minds & hearts were not changed by Trump but rather by RUSSIAN INFORMATION MACHINES.","6914":"Trump brushed it off as a hoax. He mused that it might be China, or a guy from New Jersey, or \u201csomebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\u201d He said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had assured him it wasn\u2019t true. And, he added, \u201cI really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\u201dPresident Trump has never stopped belittling the charge that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. But on Friday, with the indictment of 13 Russians for orchestrating a vast, well-funded operation to interfere in the election, those denials collided with a mountain of evidence arrayed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\nFor Mr. Trump, who has tried to discredit Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt, it was a direct assault on the version of reality that he has sought tirelessly to create. In a tweet, Mr. Trump played up Mr. Mueller\u2019s assertion that the Russian operation had begun in 2014, well before he declared his candidacy. \u201cThe Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion!\u201d he wrote.\nFar from being rattled, Mr. Trump was elated, according to his advisers, because he viewed it as evidence that Mr. Mueller now knows who the malefactors are \u2014 and they do not include him or members of his team. (The indictment refers to campaign officials who met or communicated with Russians, but says they were \u201cunwitting.\u201d)\nYet Mr. Trump sidestepped the fact that he has stubbornly denied Russia\u2019s interference, even after two assessments by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had meddled. Last November, during a trip to Asia, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Putin had told him that Russia did not meddle, and that he was inclined to believe him.\n\u201cEvery time he sees me he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think he is very insulted by it,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is not a good thing for our country.\u201d\nMr. Trump went so far as to suggest that the heads of the intelligence agencies at the time of the 2016 election \u2014 John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director \u2014 were less trustworthy than Mr. Putin. So Trump is saying everyone who has anything to do with this investgation incuding the FBI,CIA and so on are all liars. But Putin is telling the truth really?

I agree, thus far, with that. A very different situation would result if someone where to surface evidence that proves, within judicial standards of evidence, beyond a reasonable shadow of a doubt, that persons in the Trump team in any way directed, informed, or utilized the Russians in support of the Trump election bid. That is, I tend to think, extremely unlikely, but there is no definite proof that that did not occur either. So there will be a lot of public speculation. Democrats and disgruntled Republicans, as well as the disaffected and disaffiliated, within America will be speculating on the basis of their current political stance and affinity. Some will have very strong viewpoints, and will feel certain that they know who is guilty and who is not, as well as of what they are guilty. That presents a big, somewhat unusual, problem. It is the type of problem that demands that the stops be pulled out and that everything possible be done to dig up \"the whole truth and nothing but the truth\" on the key questions, as to who, what, when, where and why. \n\nIt is the \"why\" part of the puzzle that is the most difficult, and yet the Mueller team seems intent on convincing America, and being convinced themselves, that the Russians did it to support Trump. They add Sanders into that category as well. There might be some judicial evidence that we do not know anything about as of yet, proving that particular, very crucial, point. However, the full text of the indictment, although appearing very opinionated on motives, in that regard, has no real judicial evidence to offer that proves that opinion to be justified. The link between the accused Russians and the Trump team is still quite lacking. There is no evidence of collusion. \n\nI contend that there is no solid evidence of the Russians motive. That the allegations, rather read that as \"opinions\", as to Russian motives are still quite baseless as to actual evidentiary facts, and their proper interpretation. Sloppy workmanship, it might seem, for such a veteran FBI man who should likely know better. Unless Mueller is going to suddenly pull a rabbit out of his hat, the idea that the Russians were fully and solely intent on supporting Donald Trump's election to the Presidency, seems fatally flawed, and likely will be seen as such judicially. Certainly there is plenty of room to poke lots of holes in that theory. Unless again, Mueller pulls a rabbit out of his hat, that he has not given any indications of being able to produce. \n\nThus far the one side inquiry seems intent to tie any evidence of foreign wrong doing to the Trump campaign and to Donald Trump, directly or indirectly. I do not see that point as being proven to any sufficient extent. It still ranks in the realm of slander and libel, not judicial fact, though that could change, if the solid evidence comes forward that we currently do not really see any of. After all the Russians could have been slamming Hillary Clinton for the purpose of making it look like the Trump team is involved and\/or doing that. That, as I have discussed previously, and in detail, would NOT help Trump's election. It is very arguable, based on what experts know about such things, that that type of action would harm rather than help Trump. So there is a big problem and right now, until that rabbit is materialized, Mueller looks far too partisan and biased. He might not have meant it to come out that way, but to many he will look that way, until evidence of \"collusion\" is produced, by whatever means necessary to produce it. \n\nOn the other hand it is time to call for as much attention to the Democrats, of the Clinton campaign, as being suspects of election \"collusion\" with the Russians. It could go that way if the digging commences and the political corpses are exhumed and examined in sufficient detail. There is nothing certain about the \"who done it\" on the American side of the international fence, but perhaps Vladimir Putin can help, before this mess escalates into a new Cold War, or something similarly unfortunate, as to American hatred and prejudice being fed, against Russia. That is the larger problem now. Larger than the relatively large problem of corruption within the democratic process and system that has raised the spectre of its ugly head above the horizon of so many uncertainties. \n\nThere are many reasons why Russians would have chosen to help the Clinton campaign and would have sought to do damage to the Trump campaign. The weight is on that side, and far more reason to think that the Russians feared a Republican victory. \n\nOn the other hand Mueller has made the FBI look quite bad. The simple fact that it was their job to detect, and stop, the types of actions and activities that he notes in the indictment. Why where at least some of those Russians not caught, red handed, arrested, and tried, long before now ?  They were getting away with it, and if not for the very special nature of the Mueller inquiry, and its exceptional powers, the Russians would likely have gotten away with it all. There is a very real point of concern as to the current effectiveness of FBI activities against foreign espionage, and other illegal activities. They seem ineffective at best. Odd that Mueller has, likely inadvertently, raised that very significant point. Expect some heated debate on that one too. After all if the Russians could carry out what they did in regard to election meddling imagine what foreign nations can do in the area of espionage. Seems that they have a wide open field, the USA, to operate in. Something we have suspected for a while, as Cold War wariness died down and turned its blind eye. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/muellers-new-indictments-put-the-pressure-on-trump-to-act\/2018\/02\/17\/da5b7ef8-13fa-11e8-9570-29c9830535e5_story.html?utm_term=.330ab1f20a89","7127":"EXPLAIN YOUR DRAFT DODGING.

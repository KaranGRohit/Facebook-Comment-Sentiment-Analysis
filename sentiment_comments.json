He is estimated to being worth more than a billion rubles, but that isn't so very huge, in terms of comparison to the main Russian Oligarchs. He is quite a small fish to catch. One that may have been doing more than one type of business. The restaurant business, and particularly when it caters to the rich and powerful, is sometimes known as a potential listening post. A place where things can be overheard, and sometimes said, that would not be heard and said elsewhere. It is suspected that Prigozhin was in that type of business. You can sometimes make much more from scraps of information than you can make from selling hotdogs. So that might, or might not, tie him to organized crime, who also are known to engage in that type of traditional surveillance and tend to value, as well as find useful, that type of information acquisition...... \nWhat is evident is that there is no definite tie, of any sort, between him and the Russian government. That includes Putin, despite media sensationalism describing him as \"Putin's chef\". It seems a bit misleading and a bit desperate on the part of some of the American press. While the Russian mafia might well have utilized a small fish such as Prigozhin, that does not really take him far up the ladder. That in itself raises some interesting questions about who Prigozhin was working for, and why. Russian organized crime perhaps ? That would be an interesting finding. \nOddly enough there have been prior allegations of Clinton ties to the Russian mafia. Then again there have been allegations of Trump ties to the Russian mafia as well. Both are equally suspect, on every level. Such ties might exist, and it might yet be proven that there are such ties, judicially. Which side, Democrats, or Republicans, will fall into it, at that point, is an open question. It all depends on what evidence happens to surface. \nHere is what Wikipedia provides on him. \nIn 1990, after his release, he and his stepfather set up a network to sell hot dogs.[4] Soon, according to him, 'the rubles were piling up faster than his mother could count them.'[5] He also became the manager of and 15% stakeholder in \"Contrast,\" started by Boris Spektr, a classmate from his boarding school, which was the first grocery store chain in Saint Petersburg. In 1995, when revenues began to fall, Prigozhin convinced a director at \"Contrast,\" Kiril Ziminov, to open a restaurant with him. The two opened the \"Old Customs House\" (Russian: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0422\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044f), which was one of the first elite restaurants in Saint Petersburg. In 1997, inspired by waterfront restaurants on the Seine in Paris, Prigozhin and Ziminov spent $400,000 remodeling a rusting boat on the Vyatka River and started the floating restaurant \"New Island,\" which quickly became one of the most fashionable dining spots in Saint Petersburg.[4][5] According to him, his patrons \"wanted to see something new in their lives and were tired of just eating cutlets with vodka.\" In 2001, Prigozhin personally served food to Vladimir Putin and French president Jacques Chirac when they dined at \"New Island\", and to US President George W. Bush in 2002. In 2003, Putin celebrated his birthday at \"New Island.\"[5] By 2003, Prigozhin had left his business partners and established his own independent restaurants. The Anti-Corruption Foundation accused Prigozhin of corrupt business practices; his illegal wealth estimated to be worth more than one billion rubles.[6]", "id": "1869", "sentiment_score": 0.11077247888723299}, {"comment": "Russia made me vote for Trump in the sense that I didn't want Hillary to start World War 3 with them by blowing their planes out of the sky...

And in 2016, they were vindicated, as we suffered a cyber thrust into the very heart of our democracy, the election of President.\n\nAs the 2018 election approaches, Do we prepare for the next onslaught? Hardly. Trump has given no directive that direct action be taken to prevent or blunt another Russian cyberattack, nor is there in place any credible deterrence. In fact, Trump\u2019s administration has chosen NOT to implement new sanctions that were ordered against a Russia as punishment for their 2016 interference. \n\nThe NYTimes writes, \u201cThere should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,\u201d said Mr. Coats, testifying alongside Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director; Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director; and other leading intelligence officials.\n\n\u201cThroughout the entire community, we have not seen any evidence of any significant change from last year,\u201d Mr. Coats said.\n\nThe warnings were striking in their contrast to President Trump\u2019s public comments. He has mocked the very notion of Russian meddling in the last election and lashed out at those who suggested otherwise.\n\nMr. Trump has not directed his intelligence officials to specifically combat Russian interference, they said. But Mr. Pompeo said that the president has made clear that the C.I.A. has \u201can obligation, from the foreign intelligence perspective, to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s a deep and thorough understanding of every threat, including threats from Russia.\u201d\n\nRussia appears eager to spread information \u2014 real and fake \u2014 that deepens political divisions. Bot armies promoted partisan causes on social media, including the recent push to release a Republican congressional memo critical of law enforcement officials.\n\nThe bots have also sought to portray the F.B.I. and Justice Department as infected by partisan bias, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee.\n\n\u201cOther threats to our institutions come from right here at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been some, aided and abetted by Russian internet bots and trolls, who have attacked the basic integrity of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.

He mused that it might be China, or a guy from New Jersey, or \u201csomebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\u201d He said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had assured him it wasn\u2019t true. And, he added, \u201cI really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\u201dPresident Trump has never stopped belittling the charge that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. But on Friday, with the indictment of 13 Russians for orchestrating a vast, well-funded operation to interfere in the election, those denials collided with a mountain of evidence arrayed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\nFor Mr. Trump, who has tried to discredit Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation as a politically motivated witch hunt, it was a direct assault on the version of reality that he has sought tirelessly to create. In a tweet, Mr. Trump played up Mr. Mueller\u2019s assertion that the Russian operation had begun in 2014, well before he declared his candidacy. \u201cThe Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion!\u201d he wrote.\nFar from being rattled, Mr. Trump was elated, according to his advisers, because he viewed it as evidence that Mr. Mueller now knows who the malefactors are \u2014 and they do not include him or members of his team. (The indictment refers to campaign officials who met or communicated with Russians, but says they were \u201cunwitting.\u201d)\nYet Mr. Trump sidestepped the fact that he has stubbornly denied Russia\u2019s interference, even after two assessments by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had meddled. Last November, during a trip to Asia, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Putin had told him that Russia did not meddle, and that he was inclined to believe him.\n\u201cEvery time he sees me he says, \u2018I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019 and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think he is very insulted by it,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich is not a good thing for our country.\u201d\nMr. Trump went so far as to suggest that the heads of the intelligence agencies at the time of the 2016 election \u2014 John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director \u2014 were less trustworthy than Mr. Putin. So Trump is saying everyone who has anything to do with this investgation incuding the FBI,CIA and so on are all liars. But Putin is telling the truth really? Anyone who believes that Putin is honest is a fool anyone who thinks Trump is telling the truth is a fool ..wake up morons america is not the bad guy here Putin and trump are And yes Trump commited Treasson...", "id": "6914", "sentiment_score": -0.004674293960008228}, {"comment": "True", "id": "6100", "sentiment_score": 0.35}, {"comment": "REMEMBERED ALWAYS FOR RUSSIAN COLLUSION AND TREASON.", "id": "4531", "sentiment_score": 0.0}, {"comment": "So they knew about this for 4 years but did nothing to about it.

This follows the use of parables in the Bible. The Messiah relied on relating to people with everyday ordinary life experience that people could relate to. Here's an example:\n\nThe Story of a Man Named Ken\n\nOnce upon a time there was a man named Ken. People loved and respected Ken so much they began naming suff after him. As Americans explored and settled the wild west they began establishing new states. A particularly hilly region organized and requested Statehood to join America. Contemplating what to name this new United State, they decided it needed to be named after the man named Ken. So being hilly and all this provided many little hidden valley's known as tucky's. Thus the State of Ken's Tucky or Kentucky became a US State. Now Kentucky was well known throughout the world for a special art form of story telling and talking in a manner not heard anywhere else in the world. For example when they were sharing good news with each other people would exclaim \"Dawn. That is worth Killen for\". This word was also founded on naming things after Ken. They just put \"ill\" in the middle of Ken. Example\" One lucky fella got lucky and proudly proclaimed he had got a date with the most attractive women in town. She was a Playboy Model. Folks proclaimed \"Now that is worth killen for \" with great emphasis and joy for the fella. \n\nSo the word Ken become used as the starting point to create new names of things people wanted to talk about. Do a word search and see how many times folks made words using the man named Ken. \n\nNow to the point of the Story. President Donald Trump's highest and truly remarkable achievement? In ONLY his first year in office is (drum roll please): He has told MORE STORIES than ALL OTHER PRESIDENTS COMBINED. IN JUST ONE YEAR. A feat that will never be equaled.\n\nWhat do you think is the moral of this story about A Man Named Ken?A", "id": "3673", "sentiment_score": 0.23613501082251082}, {"comment": "The smart people know this!!", "id": "3046", "sentiment_score": 0.33482142857142855}, {"comment": "Suspend eld mandate", "id": "4909", "sentiment_score": 0.0}, {"comment": "Dream on Donnie.

The shooter got off 150 shots. It is a multiple people killer in a short period of time. There is absolutely NO WAY anybody can justify having such gun in their possession. Don't care who you are. YOU DO NOT NEED AN ASSAULT RIFLE!!! This is a total no brainer There is no defense to a spray of bullets mowing people down. And there is no defense to the public owning one. They MUST BE BANNED AGAIN.\n2. Advertising - I am sick to death of seeing billboards with these weapons (or any weapons) and publications in the weekly newspapers. In my hometown newspaper, there is a constant deluge of advertising and pictures of these assault rifles. It turns my stomach. These guns should not be advertised.\n\nThose two things are ACTION. There should be no resistance to these 2 things. PERIOD. That's what you can do, Trump.\n\nAnd your tweet.........about attempting to blame other people.....you are vile. I don't expect you to do a thing. It's like getting blood out of a turnip. But I do know this, your time is coming. You can kiss any hopes of re-election good bye and the mid-terms are going to tilt your apple cart. It has already started with 36 losses by the GOP to the other party in legislative races.

I agree, thus far, with that. A very different situation would result if someone where to surface evidence that proves, within judicial standards of evidence, beyond a reasonable shadow of a doubt, that persons in the Trump team in any way directed, informed, or utilized the Russians in support of the Trump election bid. That is, I tend to think, extremely unlikely, but there is no definite proof that that did not occur either. So there will be a lot of public speculation. Democrats and disgruntled Republicans, as well as the disaffected and disaffiliated, within America will be speculating on the basis of their current political stance and affinity. Some will have very strong viewpoints, and will feel certain that they know who is guilty and who is not, as well as of what they are guilty. That presents a big, somewhat unusual, problem. It is the type of problem that demands that the stops be pulled out and that everything possible be done to dig up \"the whole truth and nothing but the truth\" on the key questions, as to who, what, when, where and why. \n\nIt is the \"why\" part of the puzzle that is the most difficult, and yet the Mueller team seems intent on convincing America, and being convinced themselves, that the Russians did it to support Trump. They add Sanders into that category as well. There might be some judicial evidence that we do not know anything about as of yet, proving that particular, very crucial, point. However, the full text of the indictment, although appearing very opinionated on motives, in that regard, has no real judicial evidence to offer that proves that opinion to be justified. The link between the accused Russians and the Trump team is still quite lacking. There is no evidence of collusion. \n\nI contend that there is no solid evidence of the Russians motive. That the allegations, rather read that as \"opinions\", as to Russian motives are still quite baseless as to actual evidentiary facts, and their proper interpretation. Sloppy workmanship, it might seem, for such a veteran FBI man who should likely know better. Unless Mueller is going to suddenly pull a rabbit out of his hat, the idea that the Russians were fully and solely intent on supporting Donald Trump's election to the Presidency, seems fatally flawed, and likely will be seen as such judicially. Certainly there is plenty of room to poke lots of holes in that theory. Unless again, Mueller pulls a rabbit out of his hat, that he has not given any indications of being able to produce. \n\nThus far the one side inquiry seems intent to tie any evidence of foreign wrong doing to the Trump campaign and to Donald Trump, directly or indirectly. I do not see that point as being proven to any sufficient extent. It still ranks in the realm of slander and libel, not judicial fact, though that could change, if the solid evidence comes forward that we currently do not really see any of. After all the Russians could have been slamming Hillary Clinton for the purpose of making it look like the Trump team is involved and/or doing that. That, as I have discussed previously, and in detail, would NOT help Trump's election. It is very arguable, based on what experts know about such things, that that type of action would harm rather than help Trump. So there is a big problem and right now, until that rabbit is materialized, Mueller looks far too partisan and biased. He might not have meant it to come out that way, but to many he will look that way, until evidence of \"collusion\" is produced, by whatever means necessary to produce it. \n\nOn the other hand it is time to call for as much attention to the Democrats, of the Clinton campaign, as being suspects of election \"collusion\" with the Russians. It could go that way if the digging commences and the political corpses are exhumed and examined in sufficient detail. There is nothing certain about the \"who done it\" on the American side of the international fence, but perhaps Vladimir Putin can help, before this mess escalates into a new Cold War, or something similarly unfortunate, as to American hatred and prejudice being fed, against Russia. That is the larger problem now. Larger than the relatively large problem of corruption within the democratic process and system that has raised the spectre of its ugly head above the horizon of so many uncertainties. \n\nThere are many reasons why Russians would have chosen to help the Clinton campaign and would have sought to do damage to the Trump campaign. The weight is on that side, and far more reason to think that the Russians feared a Republican victory. \n\nOn the other hand Mueller has made the FBI look quite bad. The simple fact that it was their job to detect, and stop, the types of actions and activities that he notes in the indictment. Why where at least some of those Russians not caught, red handed, arrested, and tried, long before now ?  They were getting away with it, and if not for the very special nature of the Mueller inquiry, and its exceptional powers, the Russians would likely have gotten away with it all. There is a very real point of concern as to the current effectiveness of FBI activities against foreign espionage, and other illegal activities. They seem ineffective at best. Odd that Mueller has, likely inadvertently, raised that very significant point. Expect some heated debate on that one too. After all if the Russians could carry out what they did in regard to election meddling imagine what foreign nations can do in the area of espionage. Seems that they have a wide open field, the USA, to operate in. Something we have suspected for a while, as Cold War wariness died down and turned its blind eye. \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/muellers-new-indictments-put-the-pressure-on-trump-to-act/2018/02/17/da5b7ef8-13fa-11e8-9570-29c9830535e5_story.html?utm_term=.330ab1f20a89", "id": "7126", "sentiment_score": 0.02721064385350102}, {"comment": "I accept this statement as the truth the end.", "id": "2272", "sentiment_score": 0.0}, {"comment": "God bless great again", "id": "5408", "sentiment_score": 0.8}, {"comment": "Never did Russia influence my vote for President Donald Trump !!!
